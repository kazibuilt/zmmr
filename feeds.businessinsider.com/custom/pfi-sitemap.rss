Here are a few other features to consider when opening up a business bank account:</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/monthly-bank-maintenance-fee">Monthly bank maintenance fees</a></strong>: Financial institutions may charge a fee if you don&#39;t maintain a certain account balance or fulfill certain monthly transaction requirements. If you want to avoid fees altogether, online banks may have more appealing options than brick-and-mortar banks because they often have accounts that do not charge any monthly fees.</li><li><strong>Opening deposit requirements</strong>: A minimum opening deposit is how much money you&#39;ll need to open an account. Some business bank accounts do not have a minimum opening deposit requirement, though.</li><li><strong>Mobile/<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-online-banks">online banking</a>: </strong>If you&#39;re an avid mobile app user, review the mobile app ratings and reviews of a particular financial institution before opening an account. Also, if you are banking with an online-only financial institution, check the customer support hours and availability methods.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Additional features offered:&nbsp;</strong>One feature that distinguishes money market accounts from savings accounts is that the former may offer debit card or check-writing privileges.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>FDIC/NCUA insurance:&nbsp;</strong>Business bank accounts are federally insured up to $250,000 per depositor, per account category. If you plan to deposit more than $250,000 in an individual account, there are ways to keep your money federally insured. You can choose to spread your money across multiple financial institutions or find an institution that&#39;s part of the IntraFi Network (a program that spreads your money across other <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/fdic">FDIC-insured</a> financial institutions in the network).</li><li><strong>Overall banking experience:&nbsp;</strong>Think about whether you plan to open other types of business bank accounts or products, like a business line of credit or a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-small-business-credit-card">business credit card</a>.</li></ul><h2 data-toc-label="FAQs">Business savings account APY FAQs</h2><h3 class="faq-question">Does a business savings account earn interest?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Yes, many business savings accounts can earn interest. Most financial institutions offer business savings or business money market accounts.</p><h3 class="faq-question">What bank has the best business savings account?</h3><p class="faq-answer">First Internet Bank of Indiana offers the highest interest rate for a business bank account.

You might consider opening a high-yield business savings account if you are saving for a specific business goal or want to have an account for emergency reserves.</p><h3 class="faq-question">Are business savings accounts taxed?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Yes, interest earned from business savings accounts is taxable.

See <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-we-rate-personal-loans" class="not-content-link" target="_blank">how we rate personal loans</a> to write unbiased product reviews.</p><p>An online loan works like this: You apply to borrow a certain amount of money. The lender will show which offers you qualify for based on factors such as your credit score, debt-to-income ratio, and ability to repay the loan. The best online personal loans will offer a variety of term lengths and low interest rates.</p><p>Some lenders have minimum credit score requirements that might make you ineligible for one of their loans. Others may allow you to get a loan with a poor credit score, but could saddle you with high interest rates as a result. If you&#39;re going to borrow money with an online loan, make sure you understand how much it will cost you each month, and that you have a plan to pay it back.</p><p>Be sure you&#39;ve exhausted other options before you apply for a loan online, such as borrowing money from&nbsp; friends or family, taking out a home equity loan, or in some cases, using a credit card. These options may offer better interest rates than an online loan.</p><p>If you want to turn to an online loan provider, here are a few of the best places to start your search.</p><h2>Best Online Personal Loans</h2><ul><li><strong>Best for large loan amounts: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/lightstream-personal-loan-review">LightStream Personal Loan</a></strong></li><li><strong>Best for good credit: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/sofi-personal-loans-review">SoFi Personal Loan</a></strong></li><li><strong> Best for lower credit scores: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/avant-personal-loan-review">Avant Personal Loan</a></strong></li><li><strong>Best for credit card consolidation: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/happy-money-payoff-personal-loans-review">Payoff Loan™</a></strong></li><li><strong>Best for small loan amounts: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/upstart-personal-loan-review">Upstart Personal Loan</a></strong></li></ul><h2 data-toc-label="Compare the Best Online Personal Loans">&nbsp;</h2><h2>Best Online Personal Loan Company Reviews</h2><p>The best online personal loans offer the convenience of signing up from home, plus quick access to funds. We chose the best online loans by looking at lenders&#39; trustworthiness across sites like the Better Business Bureau, and by focusing on the following features: loan term options, loan amounts offered, interest rates, and minimum credit score.</p><h3 data-toc-label="Best for large loan amounts"><strong>Best for large loan amounts: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/lightstream-personal-loan-review">LightStream Personal Loan</a></strong></h3><h3>&nbsp;</h3><p>&#39;s online loans are best for those with good credit. While you can qualify for a loan with a minimum score of 660, you won&#39;t be able to take advantage of LightStream&#39;s lower rates without a score of around 800. The lender also has slightly more stringent eligibility requirements than some of our other top picks, including several years of credit history, stable income, and few or no payment delinquencies on your credit report.</p><p>If you&#39;re looking to borrow a large sum of money, LightStream&#39;s maximum loan amount of $100,000 is significantly higher than most of the other lenders on our list. Its minimum APR is one of the lower on our list of top picks, reducing the overall cost of your loan.</p><p><em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/lightstream-personal-loan-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LightStream Personal Loan Review</a></em></p><h3 data-toc-label="Best for good credit"><strong>Best for good credit: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/sofi-personal-loans-review">SoFi Personal Loan</a></strong></h3><h3>&nbsp;</h3><p> has the highest minimum credit score requirement of any lender on our list. You&#39;ll need at least a credit score of 680 to get one of its personal loans online. But if you do qualify, you may like the lender&#39;s low rates, high range in loan amounts, and unique perks.</p><p>Even if your credit history isn&#39;t immaculate and you aren&#39;t eligible for SoFi&#39;s lowest rate, the company&#39;s maximum APR is the lowest on our list. SoFi offers a higher maximum online loan amount than most other lenders, allowing you to take out up to $100,000.</p><p>Additionally, the company has no <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-an-origination-fee">origination fees</a> required and has no late payment penalty, lowering the overall cost of your loan. If you lose your job through no fault of your own, SoFi also has an unemployment protection program. If approved for the program, SoFi will put your loans into forbearance, suspending your monthly payments. It&#39;s worth noting that interest will continue to accrue on your loan when it is in forbearance.&nbsp;</p><p><em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/sofi-personal-loans-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SoFi Personal Loan Review</a> </em></p><h3 data-toc-label="Best for lower credit scores"><strong>Best for lower credit scores: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/avant-personal-loan-review">Avant Personal Loan</a></strong></h3><h3>&nbsp;</h3><p> is one of the easier lenders to qualify for on our list. Its minimum credit is just a guideline, not a requirement, but most borrowers who get Avant&#39;s personal loans online have a credit score between 600 and 700. However, you can likely get a lower rate elsewhere if you have a high credit score. The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-zero-interest-credit-cards">best 0% APR credit cards</a>&nbsp;may also offer a lower APR, provided you&#39;re eligible.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are looking for a smaller loan, Avant&#39;s $2,000 minimum is lower than most comparable lenders. Avant funds online loans quickly &mdash; if the company approves your loan by 4:30 p.m. CT Monday through Friday, funds are often put into your account by the next business day.</p><p>Avant also has excellent customer service hours, with its phone line open at least 13 hours every day of the week. The lender also has a strong mobile app, which is something not all lenders offer.&nbsp;</p><p><em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/avant-personal-loan-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avant Personal Loan Review</a></em></p><h3 data-toc-label="Best for credit card consolidation"><strong>Best for credit card consolidation: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/happy-money-payoff-personal-loans-review">Payoff Loan™</a></strong></h3><h3>&nbsp;</h3><p> could be another good option for an online loan if you have a lower credit score, as its minimum requirement of 640 is relatively low. If you have a good credit score, the company also offers one of the lowest APRs of lenders on the list.&nbsp;</p><p>Happy Money&#39;s Payoff online loans are specifically designed to help borrowers eliminate high-interest credit card debt. This means you are limited in what you can use your loan for &mdash; you should choose a different lender if you aren&#39;t aiming to consolidate credit card debt.&nbsp;</p><p>The company doesn&#39;t charge any prepayment fees or late fees, but may charge an origination fee between 0% to 5%. Happy Money also has one of the slowest money transfer times of any online loan company, as it takes between two to five business days to have money deposited in your account.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/happy-money-payoff-personal-loans-review"><em>Happy Money </em><em>Personal Loan Review</em></a></p><h3 data-toc-label="Best for small loan amounts"><strong>Best for small loan amounts: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/upstart-personal-loan-review">Upstart Personal Loan</a></strong></h3><h3>&nbsp;</h3><p>You may qualify for an online loan more easily with Upstart than with some of the other lenders on our list &mdash; the minimum credit requirement for  is 600. As a result, if your credit score is low, you might end up paying a high APR and could potentially get a better deal elsewhere.&nbsp;</p><p>Upstart offers the smallest loan amount of all the lenders on our top picks, so if you just need a little cash to tide you over, this could be the lender for you. Additionally, the company usually funds loans within one business day, which is useful if you need your money fast.&nbsp;</p><p><em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/upstart-personal-loan-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Upstart Personal Loan Review</a></em></p><h2>Online Loan Lender Trustworthiness</h2><p>Whether you&#39;re interested in taking out a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-to-get-a-5000-loan" rel="" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="100" data-uri="f55021e43de1422ef665728c34bd0aea">$5,000 loan</a>&nbsp;or a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/20000-personal-loan" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="100" data-uri="a6e8a2968cdc266e82c564328043c93b">$20,000 loan</a>, finding the right lender can help improve your experience and increase the likelihood of success with your online personal loan application.

Bear in mind money is safe at a federally insured financial institution.

That&#39;s several percentage points higher than other CDs that are currently being offered. It also requires a low minimum deposit of $500.</p><p>However, the criteria you need to meet in order to open the certificate are steep. First of all, you can only put a maximum of $3,000 in the CD. Second of all, the money in the CD has to be new, which means it can&#39;t have previously been in a California Coast Credit Union account. You&#39;ll also need some sort of other account with California Coast Credit Union to get the high APY.&nbsp; You can have an active checking account (meaning it has one transaction a month), a new money market account with a minimum balance of $5,000, a new regular certificate with a minimum balance of $5,000, a new IRA certificate with a minimum balance of $5,000, or a new funded consumer loan that isn&#39;t either a credit card or a share-secured or certificate-secured loan.</p><p>You also need to be a member of California Coast Credit Union.

However, it also offers two other no-penalty CDs that also have strong rates.

Its 6-month CD is its strongest traditional CD, but it also offers a variable rate 2-year CD that&#39;s currently offering a high APY. Keep in mind, though, that variable rate CDs&#39; rates aren&#39;t locked in, unlike regular CDs.&nbsp;</p><p>Newtek Bank CDs require a minimum opening deposit of $2,500, which is higher than other banks.

You can open one at almost any bank or credit union.</p><h3 class="faq-question">Who is paying the highest CD rates right now?</h3><p class="faq-answer">California Coast Credit Union is currently offering the highest CD rate with its 5-month celebration certificate. It pays 9.50% APY, but this CD special only allows a $3,000 maximum opening deposit and requires you to have another bank account with the credit union that meets certain requirements. To become a member and open a certificate, you must live, work, or go to school in San Diego or Riverside counties, or be part of select employee groups.</p><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>Are 10-year CD rates worth it?&nbsp;</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">When choosing a CD term, you&#39;ll want to consider the timeline of your goal. That said, not many financial institutions offer 10-year CDs, and the rates are better for <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/short-term-cd-rates" rel="" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="80" data-mrf-link="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/short-term-cd-rates" data-uri="4146b78cda804edff1b0745c477dcf8c">short-term CD rates vs long-term CD rates</a> right now. You could build a CD ladder if you want to diversify your CDs and open multiple terms for more flexibility.</p><h3 class="faq-question">Where can I earn 5% on a CD?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Several financial institutions have <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/5-percent-certificate-of-deposit-cd">CDs offering 5.00% APY</a> or more. Some examples include (but are not limited to) Raisin, Citizens, and BMO Alto.</p><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>Are there any 7% CDs?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">Currently, there aren&#39;t any CDs that offer 7% APY. California Coast Credit Union also offers a CD paying over 9% APY, though.</p><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>Are there any 6% CDs?&nbsp;</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">Yes. There is one credit union, Financial Partners Credit Union, that offers <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/6-percent-certificate-of-deposit-cd">6% interest on CDs</a>. California Coast Credit Union also offers a CD paying over 9% APY. But these credit unions have membership requirements, CD deposit limitations, and are limited to people who live in a certain area and meet certain requirements.</p><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>Can you lose money in CDs?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">You cannot lose money in a CD if you leave it untouched for the full term length. It&#39;s like a locked savings account, and the only way you can lose money is if you get an <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/cd-early-withdrawal-penalties">early withdrawal penalty</a> for taking money out before the term length is over.</p><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>Do you have to pay taxes on CD interest?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">Yes, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/are-certificates-of-deposit-taxable">CDs are taxable</a>. Banks send a 1099-INT form and you report CD interest in your annual tax return.</p><h3 class="faq-question">How high will CD rates go in 2024?</h3><p class="faq-answer">In early 2024, experts predict CD rates will be on par with current rates. However, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/will-cd-rates-go-up-in-2024">CD rates are likely to drop in 2024</a> when the Federal Reserve starts cutting rates.</p><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>Are CDs a good investment?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">Timing matters. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/are-cds-a-good-investment">CDs are a good investment</a> if interest rates are currently high and/or expected to fall. The biggest benefit of a CD is your ability to lock in a fixed interest rate. If interest rates fall during the term of your CD, the APY on your CD will not be affected. Conversely, if rates are expected to rise, then it may not be a good time to put money in a CD.</p><h3 class="faq-question">What is the best CD rate for $100,000?</h3><p class="faq-answer">The best CD rate for you will depend heavily on what term length you&#39;re interested in. However, Newtek Bank currently offers a CD for new customers with a six-month term length that offers a very high APY of 5.55%, and it allows you to put up to $250,000 into it.</p><h3 class="faq-question">Should I buy a CD now or wait?</h3><p class="faq-answer">It may be worthwhile to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/cd-rates-slide-now-time-to-lock-in-2023-12">lock in a CD rate</a> if it fits with your savings goals. If you don&#39;t need to have access to your money, a CD could be a good place for short-term goals. However, you&#39;ll need to be mindful of early withdrawal penalties.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Best CD Rates by Term">Best CD Rates by Term</h2><p>Below, you&#39;ll find our picks for the best CD rates right now.

And then if you can continuously add money in. Also, check not just what the interest rate is, but how often they pay out interest, whether it&#39;s monthly or quarterly.&#34;</p><p><strong>How should someone choose a CD term length?</strong></p><p><strong>Roger Ma, certified financial planner with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lifelaidout.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-post-depth="100" data-uri="bbf682cdd410d88e2c3adca93d67b592" data-analytics-module="body_link">lifelaidout®</a>&nbsp;and author of&nbsp;<span>&#34;Work Your Money, Not Your Life&#34;</span>:</strong></p><p>&#34;I would think about when you need the money and then compare that with what the prevailing CD rates are, and then what makes sense from a financial perspective, but also from your own personal timing perspective.&#34;</p><p><strong>Mykail James, CFEI: </strong></p><p>&#34;I believe in having a plan for whatever the funds are. If it&#39;s supposed to be a house fund, and you want to wait for another two years to buy a house, that&#39;s what you should be thinking of when you want to have this money.&#34;</p><p><strong>How should someone decide whether to put their money in a high-yield savings account, money market account, or CD?</strong></p><p><strong>Tania Brown, certified financial planner and vice president of coaching strategy at <a href="https://www.ofcolor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OfColor</a>:</strong></p><p>&#34;So I guess we&#39;ll start off with how much money you want to put in and the level of transactions you want to have. If you want to have any transactions, that automatically takes out CDs. Then you&#39;re stuck between the high-yield savings and the money market account.&#34;</p><p><strong>Sophia Acevedo, certified educator in personal finance, banking editor, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-post-depth="100" data-uri="06d5d843a1e77bf6ad8215a6e4467c89" data-analytics-module="body_link">Business Insider</a>:</strong></p><p>&#34;Generally, I think a high-yield savings account or money market account could be good options for an emergency fund or short-term savings goals. A high-yield savings account offers a higher interest rate than traditional savings accounts at brick-and-mortar banks. Meanwhile, money market accounts might be worth considering if you want more account accessibility &mdash; several offer paper checks, ATM cards, or debit cards. CDs could be worthwhile if you don&#39;t need access to some of your money, since they have a fixed interest rate for a specific term.&#34;</p><h3><strong>Methodology: How We Chose the Best CDs&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>At Business Insider, we aim to help smart people make the best decisions with their money. We understand that &#34;best&#34; is often subjective, so in addition to highlighting the clear benefits of a financial product or account &mdash; a high Annual Percentage Yield (<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-apy#:~:text=Written%20by%20Dori%20Zinn%3B%20edited,FG%20Trade%2FGetty">APY</a>), for example &mdash; we outline the limitations, too. We spent hours comparing and contrasting the features and fine print of various products so you don&#39;t have to.</p><p>We reviewed CD offerings from over three dozen national banks using our <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-we-rate-cds-certificates-of-deposit">CD methodology</a>.

There are personal loans for borrowers who want a sizeable chunk of money and for those who just need a small amount to tide them over.</p><h2>Best Personal Loans of 2024</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/lightstream-personal-loan-review">LightStream Personal Loan</a>: Best for excellent credit</li><li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/service-credit-union-personal-loans-review">Service Credit Union Personal Loan</a>: Best for customer support</li><li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/sofi-personal-loans-review">SoFi Personal Loan</a>: Best for fair credit</li><li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/penfed-credit-union-personal-loans-review">PenFed Credit Union Personal Loan</a>: Best for small loan amounts</li><li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/avant-personal-loan-review">Avant Personal Loan</a>: Best for low credit</li><li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/upstart-personal-loan-review">Upstart Personal Loan</a>: Best for borrowers with limited credit history</li><li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/wells-fargo-personal-loan-review">Wells Fargo Personal Loan</a>: Best for flexible terms</li></ul><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>Compare the Top Personal Loans</h2><p>The best personal loans will offer fast money when you need it, without astronomical fees and interest rates. We looked at loan providers that cater to a variety of credit scores and offer a range of loan term lengths. The best personal loans aren&#39;t necessarily from big-name banks; credit unions generally offer lower interest rates, and you can find strong options through online banks, too.</p><p>Here are the best personal loans as picked by Business Insider editors in 2024.</p><h3 data-toc-label="LightStream Personal Loan"><strong>Best for excellent credit: </strong><strong>LightStream Personal Loan</strong></h3><p>LightStream stands out with some of the lowest personal loan rates available for borrowers with excellent credit scores. Truist created LightStream for online loans, and the bank offers personal loans for things like home remodels, medical debt, and debt consolidation.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Look out for: </strong>High credit score requirements. LightStream&#39;s minimum credit requirement for a personal loan is 660, so this lender might not be right for all credit types. &nbsp;</p><p><em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/lightstream-personal-loan-review">LightStream Personal Loan Review</a></em></p><h3><strong>Best for customer support: </strong><strong>Service Credit Union Personal Loan</strong></h3><p>Service Credit Union has some of the best customer support among personal loan lenders and can get you your money fast. Customer support is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The approval process takes about 24 hours, and after your loan application is accepted, you may be able to have the funds in your account the same day.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Look out for: </strong>Membership requirements. Much like with most credit unions, you&#39;ll need to meet certain requirements to be eligible. If you&#39;ve served in the military or Department of Defense or work at qualifying associations or organizations, you&#39;ll qualify. If that doesn&#39;t apply to you, you can join the American Consumer Council for free with a promo code.&nbsp;</p><p><em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/service-credit-union-review">Service Credit Union Review</a></em></p><h3 data-toc-label="PenFed Credit Union Personal Loan"><strong>Best for small loan amounts: </strong><strong>PenFed Credit Union Personal Loan</strong></h3><p>PenFed Credit Union offers personal loans for smaller amounts than many other lenders, making it a good choice for those who just need to borrow a little bit of money for a short time. PenFed will lend you as little as $600. This could make the credit union an attractive alternative to a payday loan.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Look out for: </strong>Membership requirements. You don&#39;t need to be a member of the credit union to apply for a personal loan, but you&#39;ll have to be a member to get your loan. If you&#39;ve served in the military or work at qualifying associations or organizations, you&#39;ll qualify.</p><p>However, you have a pretty easy workaround if that doesn&#39;t apply. You can join by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/pentagon-federal-credit-union-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="40" data-uri="faf64fde1516a48a6bfde969853f0620">opening a savings account</a>&nbsp;with a $5 minimum deposit.</p><p><em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/penfed-credit-union-personal-loans-review">PenFed Personal Loan Review</a></em></p><h3 data-toc-label="SoFi Personal Loan"><strong>Best for fair credit: </strong><strong>SoFi Personal Loan</strong></h3><p>SoFi personal loans have a minimum credit score requirement of 680, at the lower end of what&#39;s considered a good credit score. People with a good credit score will likely be able to get a good rate with SoFi, but borrowers with an excellent credit score may be able to get a lower rate with LightStream. SoFi offers forbearance in case you lose your job during your loan repayment. This unique feature allows you to apply for as many of 12 months of forbearance, in three-month increments.</p><p>Interest rates on these loans range by about 13 percentage points, making for a smaller range than offered by other companies. This means interest rates for borrowers with relatively lower credit scores can only go so high.</p><p><strong>Look out for:&nbsp;</strong>A relatively high minimum income for approval. According to <span>loan comparison site Credible</span>, less than 1% of borrowers approved for personal loans through SoFi have an income of less than $50,000 per year, and a majority make more than $100,000.&nbsp;</p><p><em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/sofi-personal-loans-review">SoFi Personal Loan Review</a></em></p><h3 data-toc-label="Avant Personal Loan"><strong>Best for low credit: </strong><strong>Avant Personal Loan</strong></h3><p>Avant stands out as a lender that applicants with low credit scores can turn to for personal loans. Personal loans are generally offered to those with better credit scores. Avant offers personal loan options for borrowers with credit scores as low as 600. It has a lower limit than other lenders, with $35,000 as the maximum loan amount.</p><p><strong>Look out for:&nbsp;</strong>Administrative fees. Avant&#39;s personal loans carry up to 4.75% in administration fees with an undisclosed late fee and returned payment fee. Considering that many of the other loans on this list don&#39;t carry administrative fees, prepayment fees, or <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-an-origination-fee">origination fees</a>, Avant&#39;s fee is high.&nbsp;</p><p>It&#39;s also worth noting that interest rates are high from this lender. While this is a good option for anyone with credit scores in the lower 600s, those with better credit could find better rates elsewhere.&nbsp;</p><p><em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/avant-personal-loan-review">Avant Personal Loans Review</a></em></p><h3 data-toc-label="Upstart Personal Loan"><strong>Best for borrowers with limited credit history: </strong><strong>Upstart Personal Loan</strong></h3><p>Upstart differentiates itself from other personal loan lenders with its underwriting process, which is how it decides who gets a loan and how much to charge in interest. Like any lender, Upstart considers credit scores as part of the process. But it also considers employment history and education history, such as where you went to school and your area of study.</p><p><strong>Look out for: </strong>Potentially high origination fees. Upstart&#39;s personal loans can have late fee of 5% or $15, whichever is greater. This can take a significant portion out of your overall loan proceeds.&nbsp;</p><p><em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/upstart-personal-loan-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Upstart Personal Loan Review</a>&nbsp;</em></p><h3><strong>Best for flexible terms: </strong><strong>Wells Fargo Personal Loan</strong></h3><p>Wells Fargo personal loans offer low interest rates, smaller minimum borrowing amounts, and shorter terms than many others. Wells Fargo offers loans between $3,000 to $100,000, for payoff terms as short as 12 months. Borrowers who want to get their debt under control quickly might find that Wells Fargo&#39;s personal loans are flexible enough to tackle debt consolidation.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Look out for: </strong>It&#39;s worth noting Wells Fargo&#39;s history with data security and compliance. The bank has faced <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wells-fargo-sales-scandal-575-million-settlement-2018-12">several federal penalties</a> for improper customer referrals to lending and insurance products, and security issues associated with creating fake accounts several years ago.&nbsp;</p><p><em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/wells-fargo-personal-loan-review">Wells Fargo Personal Loans Review</a></em></p><h2>Personal Loan Lender Trustworthiness</h2><p>Whether you&#39;re interested in taking out a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-to-get-a-5000-loan" rel="" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="100" data-uri="f55021e43de1422ef665728c34bd0aea">$5,000 loan</a>&nbsp;or a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/40000-personal-loan" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="100" data-uri="a906eebe8e11b2fe713501817939f201">$40,000 loan</a>, finding the right provider can help with your loan approval experience. The Better Business Bureau, a non-profit organization focused on consumer protection and trust, evaluates businesses using factors like their responsiveness to consumer complaints, honesty in advertising, and clarity about business practices. Here is each company&#39;s score:</p><table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 97.4523%; height: 197px;" border="1"><tbody><tr style="height: 21px;"><td style="width: 20%; height: 21px; text-align: center;" data-sheets-value="{&#34;1&#34;:2,&#34;2&#34;:&#34;Lender&#34;}"><strong>Lender</strong></td><td style="width: 18.848%; height: 21px; text-align: center;" data-sheets-value="{&#34;1&#34;:2,&#34;2&#34;:&#34;APR&#34;}"><strong>BBB Grade</strong></td></tr><tr style="height: 22px;"><td style="width: 20%; height: 22px; text-align: center;">LightStream Personal Loan</td><td style="width: 18.848%; height: 22px; text-align: center;" data-sheets-value="{&#34;1&#34;:2,&#34;2&#34;:&#34;4.49 - 19.99%&#34;}">A+</td></tr><tr style="height: 21px;"><td style="width: 20%; height: 21px; text-align: center;" data-sheets-value="{&#34;1&#34;:2,&#34;2&#34;:&#34;SoFi&#34;}">SoFi Personal Loan</td><td style="width: 18.848%; height: 21px; text-align: center;" data-sheets-value="{&#34;1&#34;:2,&#34;2&#34;:&#34;5.99 - 18.85%&#34;}">A+</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 20%; text-align: center;">Wells Fargo Personal Loan</td><td style="width: 18.848%; text-align: center;">F</td></tr><tr style="height: 21px;"><td style="width: 20%; height: 21px; text-align: center;" data-sheets-value="{&#34;1&#34;:2,&#34;2&#34;:&#34;Avant&#34;}">Avant Personal Loan</td><td style="width: 18.848%; height: 21px; text-align: center;" data-sheets-value="{&#34;1&#34;:2,&#34;2&#34;:&#34;9.95 - 35.99%&#34;}">A</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 20%; text-align: center;">PenFed Credit Union Personal Loan</td><td style="width: 18.848%; text-align: center;">A+</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 20%; text-align: center;">Service Credit Union Personal Loan</td><td style="width: 18.848%; text-align: center;">A+</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 20%; text-align: center;">Upstart Personal Loan</td><td style="width: 18.848%; text-align: center;">A+</td></tr></tbody></table><p>All of our top picks, minus Wells Fargo, are rated A or higher by the BBB. Keep in mind that a high BBB score does not ensure a positive relationship with a lender, and that you should keep doing research and talking to others who have used the company to get the most comprehensive information possible.&nbsp;</p><p>The BBB gives Wells Fargo an F rating because of the business&#39; failure to respond to 24 complaints and government actions against the business. Most recently, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in December 2022 <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wells-fargo-cfpb-settlement-auto-loan-mortgages-2022-12">ordered Wells Fargo to return $2 billion to customers and pay a $1.7 billion penalty</a> for legal violations involving auto loans, mortgages, and deposit accounts. The bank illegally charged fees and interest penalties on auto and mortgage loans. Additionally, it misapplied payments to those loans for many customers.&nbsp;</p><p>If this history makes you uncomfortable, you may consider using one of the other personal loan lenders on our list.</p><h2>How to Choose the Best Personal Loan</h2><p>To pick the best lender for you, take stock of the factors that are most important to you. Many borrowers zero in the lowest interest rate. But be sure to also look at any fees, the minimum credit score needed, and the accessibility of the lender&#39;s customer service before you apply for personal loans.</p><p>Also look at the different types of lenders you may borrow with. Some people may feel comfortable with an online lender, while others may prefer a credit union or bank. You&#39;ll also want to make sure you&#39;re able to select a term length that works for you and that your loan&#39;s purpose is allowed by the lender you choose.</p><p>Guides like this one will help you compare multiple lenders in the same place to weigh their pros and cons. Keep in mind that you should also read individual reviews of any lenders you&#39;re considering.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="FAQs">FAQs</h2><h3 class="faq-question" data-pm-slice="1 1 []"><strong>Where can I find personal loans besides a bank?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">Smaller lenders like <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-credit-union">local credit unions</a> can often offer much lower interest rates than bigger banks and tend to be more flexible about credit requirements. It might be worth checking on their rates and terms as part of your research when you&#39;re looking for personal loans near you.</p><h3 class="faq-question" data-pm-slice="1 1 []"><strong>What are alternatives to a personal loan?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">Alternatives to personal loans include <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-zero-interest-credit-cards">0% APR credit cards,</a> which can be used to consolidate credit card debt or make purchases that you&#39;d like to pay off over time, and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/home-equity-loan-vs-heloc">home equity lines of credit</a>, which can fund <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/home-equity-loan-vs-heloc">major repairs or renovations</a> usually at lower interest rates.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="faq-question" data-pm-slice="1 1 []"><strong>How long does it take to get a personal loan?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">The time it takes to get the proceeds from a personal loan depends on the lender.

The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-quick-personal-loans-fast-cash">best quick personal loan companies</a> can get you your money either the same day or the next day.</p><h3 class="faq-question" data-pm-slice="1 1 []"><strong>What is the easiest personal loan to get approved for?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">The easiest personal loans to get approved for tend to be those with the most lenient credit score requirements. However, even the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-personal-loans-bad-credit">best loans for bad credit</a> that you you can get are likely to come with high interest rates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="Why You Should Trust Us">Why You Should Trust Us: Our Experts for the Best Personal Loans</h2><p>We consulted personal loan and financial experts to give their insights into finding the best loan companies for your needs.</p><ul><li>Markia Brown, certified financial education instructor and registered financial associate at <a href="https://app.qwoted.com/companies/money-plug-llc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Money Plug, LLC</a></li><li>Ryan Wangman, former loans reporter at Personal Finance Insider<a href="https://app.qwoted.com/companies/https-www-augustwmg-com" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-post-depth="40" data-uri="41eaeb189f20224b71c7ae895c4124c6"></a></li></ul><h3>Our Experts&#39; Advice for Choosing the Best Personal Loan</h3><h3>How does the interest rate on a personal loan affect how much I pay?</h3><p><strong>Markia Brown:</strong></p><p>&#34;The interest rate on a personal loan is the price you pay for borrowing the loan. This rate can make a massive difference in the total amount paid over time, so ensuring you have the lowest interest rate available saves you money!&#34;</p><p><strong>Ryan Wangman:</strong></p><p>&#34;Depending on the interest rate you&#39;re charged, you could end up paying hundreds or thousands of dollars more than a borrower with better credit who takes out a similar amount of money.&#34;</p><h3>If someone wants to get a lower interest rate but doesn&#39;t currently qualify for one, what should they do?</h3><p><strong>Markia Brown:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><a href="https://app.qwoted.com/companies/https-www-augustwmg-com" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-post-depth="40" data-uri="41eaeb189f20224b71c7ae895c4124c6">&#34;The first step is to pull a copy of your credit report from TransUnion, Equifax, and Experian. All you have to do is go to </a><a href="http://www.annualcreditreport.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.annualcreditreport.com</a><a href="https://app.qwoted.com/companies/https-www-augustwmg-com" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-post-depth="40" data-uri="41eaeb189f20224b71c7ae895c4124c6">.</a></p><p>After you pull your credit reports, go through them to identify what could be holding you back from qualifying for a better rate. Some of the information on your credit report is used to generate your credit score, which is used when determining if you <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-to-pre-qualify-for-personal-loan">qualify for a loan</a> and what your interest rate should be. The five sections used to calculate your credit score are your payment history, credit utilization, length of payment history, mix of accounts, and new accounts or inquiries.&#34;</p><p><strong>Ryan Wangman:</strong></p><p>&#34;The best way to get a lower rate is to improve your credit history. You can do so by making on time, reliable payments and managing the amount of debt you take out compared to your overall limit.&#34;</p><h3>Methodology</h3><p>We rate all personal loan products in our reviews and guides on a 1-5 scale. The overall rating is a weighted average that takes into account seven different categories, some of which are judged more heavily than others. They are:</p><ul><li>Interest rate (20% of rating)</li><li>Fees (20% of rating)</li><li>Term lengths and loan amounts (15% of rating)</li><li>Funding speed (15% of rating)</li><li>Borrower accessibility (15% of rating)</li><li>Customer support (7.5% of rating)</li><li>Ethics (7.5% of rating)</li></ul><p>Each category&#39;s weighting is based on its importance to your borrowing experience. Rates and fees have the most direct impact on the overall cost of your loan, so we weigh those the most heavily. Customer support and ethics are still very important parts of the borrowing experience, but do not directly tie to a personal loan&#39;s terms, so they have less of an impact on the overall rating.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-we-rate-personal-loans" rel="noopener" data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="80" data-uri="b7061d44cecd2e488c4a3e3840cc6e47">See our full ratings methodology for personal loans »&nbsp;</a></strong></p><div class="read-original">Read the original article on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-personal-loans">Business Insider</a></div>]]></content:encoded>

<li><strong>Permanent life insurance lasts your lifetime and accrues cash value in addition to offering a death benefit.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Term life lasts for a specified time and then expires, but it&#39;s cheaper than permanent life.</strong></li>
<li><strong>There are several types of term and permanent life policies, and some don&#39;t require a medical exam.</strong></li>
</ul><p>Life insurance is a contract between you and the life insurance company. You&#39;ll pay monthly or <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-an-insurance-premium-definition-cost">annual premiums</a> for coverage. If you pass away while your policy is in effect, your insurer must pay a death benefit or your policy&#39;s proceeds to your chosen beneficiary.</p><p>Life insurance is a crucial tool to manage your risk and protect your loved ones financially. &#34;If you don&#39;t make it home and someone relies on your income to live, you need life insurance,&#34; says Mark Williams, CEO of Brokers International.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-life-insurance-companies">best life insurance policy</a> for you depends on your budget as well as your financial goals. There are two main types of life insurance policies to choose from: permanent life and term life.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Term life vs. permanent life insurance">Term life vs. permanent life insurance</h2><p>The difference between term life insurance and permanent life insurance is similar to the difference between renting an apartment (term life) and owning a home (permanent life).</p><p>When you rent, you have a lease for a certain amount of time. When that lease is over, you can renew it. Likewise, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-term-life-insurance">term insurance</a> lasts for a specified period. When it ends, you can reapply for coverage, but your premiums will likely increase based on your age and health status.</p><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-permanent-life-insurance">Permanent life insurance</a> has a death benefit for your beneficiaries and a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/cash-value-life-insurance">cash value</a> you can use during your lifetime. It&#39;s like owning a home. Like a home, you build equity in your policy, which you can use as collateral. You can also use your cash value to leave a larger death benefit to your heirs when you pass away.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether you choose permanent or term life insurance, you must undergo the underwriting process. During the underwriting process, your insurer gathers information about your health, job, income, finances, and other personal information to evaluate your risk level. It may require a medical exam, which includes collecting a blood and urine sample. Based on your risk level, the insurer determines your eligibility, premiums, and coverage amount.</p><p>The table below highlights the core differences between term and permanent life insurance.&nbsp;</p><table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;" border="1"><tbody><tr><td style="width: 36.051%;"><p><strong>Term life insurance</strong></p></td><td style="width: 63.8217%;"><p><strong>Permanent life insurance</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 36.051%;"><ul><li aria-level="1">Ends after a specified time frame</li><li aria-level="1">Includes death benefit</li><li aria-level="1">More affordable</li></ul></td><td style="width: 63.8217%;"><ul><li aria-level="1">Lasts your lifetime</li><li aria-level="1">Includes a death benefit</li><li aria-level="1">Cash value that can be used during your lifetime</li><li aria-level="1">More expensive than term life in the early years of the policy</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 data-toc-label="Term life insurance&nbsp;">Term life insurance&nbsp;</h2><h3>What is it?&nbsp;</h3><p>The most popular type of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-term-life-insurance">term life insurance</a> is a level term policy. You pay fixed premiums for a designated term&mdash;usually between ten and 30 years&mdash;for a fixed death benefit. If you die during your term, your beneficiaries receive a death benefit. If you outlive your policy and pass away without renewing your coverage, your beneficiaries won&#39;t receive a death benefit.</p><p>There are also other types of term life insurance policies, some more popular or expensive than others. Take a look at the list below for the top term life policies and their features.</p><ul><li aria-level="1"><strong>Annual yearly renewable (ART): </strong>This policy provides coverage one year at a time up to a specified age, without an additional medical exam. However, premiums increase each year as you age.</li><li aria-level="1"><strong>Return of premium:</strong> Returns part or all of the money you&#39;ve already paid if you haven&#39;t used the policy once your term ends. You&#39;ll pay an extra premium for this feature.</li><li aria-level="1"><strong>Convertible term life: </strong>This allows you to convert a term life policy into permanent life insurance without additional evidence of insurability.</li></ul><h3>Who is it best for?&nbsp;</h3><p>Term life insurance provides coverage for a certain amount of time. This makes it suitable for most applicants, as most people&#39;s financial obligations decrease as they age. It&#39;s also the most <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-cheap-life-insurance">affordable life insurance</a> policy, making it accessible to most individuals. You can find our guide on the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-term-life-insurance-companies">best term life insurance</a> here.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Whole life insurance">Whole life insurance</h2><h3>What is it?&nbsp;</h3><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-whole-life-insurance">Whole life insurance</a> is a lifelong or permanent policy in which you pay a fixed premium for a guaranteed death benefit. The insurance company saves a portion of your premium in its own portfolio to increase your policy&#39;s cash value. Since whole life insurance offers many guarantees, it&#39;s one of the costlier life insurance policies.</p><h3>Who is it best for?&nbsp;</h3><p>Whole life insurance is an excellent option if you need long-term coverage, like if you have lifelong dependents or are a business owner. If you&#39;d like to build a tax-free legacy for your dependents with little to no market risk, a whole life policy may be the way to go. You can find our guide on the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-whole-life-insurance-companies">best whole life insurance</a> here.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Universal life insurance">Universal life insurance</h2><h3>What is it?&nbsp;</h3><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/universal-life-insurance">Universal life insurance</a> allows more flexibility than a whole life policy. You can raise or lower your death benefit, which increases or decreases your premiums based on your financial situation and needs. For example, if you find that you need less coverage because your children are grown up and your mortgage is almost paid off, you can lower your death benefit. As a result, this decreases your premiums.&nbsp;</p><h3>Who is it best for?&nbsp;</h3><p>If you&#39;d like lifelong coverage, steady cash value growth, and flexibility in your premium payments and coverage amounts to align with changing financial needs, universal life insurance could be the perfect policy for you. You can find our guide on the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-universal-life-insurance-companies">best universal life insurance</a> here.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Variable life insurance">Variable life insurance</h2><h3>What is it?&nbsp;</h3><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/variable-life-insurance">Variable life</a> (VL) insurance policy, a type of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-permanent-life-insurance">permanent life insurance</a>, was created years after universal life for people who didn&#39;t like how whole and universal life commingled their investments with the insurance company.&nbsp;</p><p>Your money is invested in subaccounts that track underlying mutual funds, bonds, and stocks. If the market does well, so do you. If the market falls, so does your cash value, making it riskier than whole and universal life.</p><h3>Who is it best for?&nbsp;</h3><p>VL insurance is best for someone who wants control over how their cash value is invested and can tolerate increased market risk for higher returns. Since life insurance policies tend to yield subpar returns, VL may be best suited for high-net-worth investors who have maxed out other tax-advantaged investment vehicles (i.e., 401(k)s, Individual Retirement Accounts (IRA)s, etc.).&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="Variable universal life insurance">Variable universal life insurance</h2><h3>What is it?&nbsp;</h3><p>Variable universal life (VUL) insurance is a combination of universal and variable life insurance. You can raise or lower your death benefit and have your cash value invested in subaccounts that mirror the performance of underlying investments. Again, this is risky, but if the market does well, so does your cash value.</p><h3>Who is it best for?&nbsp;</h3><p>Like a VL policy, VUL is best for those who want lifelong coverage, more investment options, and the ability to weather increased risk for higher returns. It&#39;s also suitable for those hat want flexible premium payments and coverage amounts. You can find our guide on the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-universal-life-insurance-companies">best universal life insurance</a> here.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Simplified issue life insurance">Simplified issue life insurance</h2><h3>What is it?&nbsp;</h3><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/simplified-issue-life-insurance">Simplified issue life insurance</a> doesn&#39;t require a medical exam, but you still have to complete a health questionnaire and provide access to medical records. If you fail to disclose a condition and die, your insurance company can deny death benefits to your beneficiaries.&nbsp;</p><p>It&#39;s worth noting that some insurance companies enforce graded death benefits, which refers to your insurer withholding your full death benefits for the first few years of coverage.</p><h3>Who is it best for?&nbsp;</h3><p>Simplified issue life insurance is suitable for applicants of all ages with mild to moderate medical conditions (e.g., asthma, obesity, mental health issues, etc.) You can find our guide on the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-no-medical-exam-life-insurance">best no exam life insurance</a>.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Guaranteed issue life insurance">Guaranteed issue life insurance</h2><h3>What is it?&nbsp;</h3><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/guaranteed-issue-life-insurance">Guaranteed issue life insurance</a> is easier to obtain because it doesn&#39;t require a medical exam or health questionnaire. However, it has several drawbacks. One of those drawbacks is you must be 50 and older to apply. Plus, since this policy is catered towards high-risk applicants, premiums are usually higher, and coverage amounts are limited.&nbsp;</p><p>Guaranteed issue life insurance is also known as <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/funeral-insurance-a-good-addition-to-your-life-insurance-policy">final expense insurance</a> since it offers low death benefit amounts and tends only to cover funeral and burial expenses.&nbsp;</p><h3>Who is it best for?&nbsp;</h3><p>Guaranteed issue life insurance is a viable option for individuals who struggle to obtain traditional life insurance, like seniors, smokers, and applications with chronic, severe, terminal illnesses or multiple health conditions. You can find our guide on the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-life-insurance-for-seniors">best life insurance for seniors</a> here.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Group life insurance">Group life insurance</h2><h3>What is it?&nbsp;</h3><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/group-life-insurance">Group life insurance</a> is employer-provided life insurance, usually offered for free as part of the company&#39;s benefits. However, if you are discharged, retire, or quit, you will lose coverage. Plus, group life insurance usually has limited coverage amounts and options compared to private life insurers.&nbsp;</p><h3>Who is it best for?&nbsp;</h3><p>Consider group life insurance if you&#39;re employed with a company that offers this benefit and you anticipate staying with the company in the long run.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="Choosing the right type of life insurance">Choosing the right type of life insurance</h2><p>The best life insurance policy for you depends on your budget and financial situation. If you have a fixed income with temporary needs, term life insurance may be best for you. If you have health issues that may prevent you from traditional coverage, you may want to consider <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/no-medical-exam-life-insurance">no medical examination life insurance</a>. If you want coverage for your dependents in the event of your untimely death, then a term life policy works. If you want to build wealth and leave a legacy, a permanent life insurance policy is best.</p><p>Your life insurance needs will change as you age, and you&#39;ll need to consider <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/life-insurance-for-children">children</a>, marriage, divorce, retirement, and caring for aging parents. Consider consulting a financial advisor, estate attorney, and accountant to ensure you have the proper coverage for your goals and life changes. Also, talk to your insurance agent or financial planner about what works best for you and your budget based on your financial situation.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Types of insurance FAQs">Types of insurance FAQs</h2><h3 class="faq-question">What&#39;s the main difference between term and whole life insurance?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Term life insurance provides coverage for a certain period of time (usually ten to 30 years). Whole life insurance offers lifelong coverage along with a cash value component.</p><h3 class="faq-question">Can I switch from term to whole life insurance?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Many term policies have built-in term-to-perm conversion options. If not, you can include it as a rider or an add-on to your policy at an additional premium. This allows you to convert your term policy to a whole life policy without undergoing an additional medical exam or health questionnaire.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="faq-question">How do investment components work in life insurance policies?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Policies like variable life and variable universal life insurance insurance allow policyholders to invest the cash value in separate accounts that track underlying investments, This offers the potential for growth but exposes you to market volatility, increasing your risk.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="faq-question">Is it worth getting life insurance with no medical exam?</h3><p class="faq-answer">If you don&#39;t qualify for traditional life insurance, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/no-medical-exam-life-insurance">no medical exam</a> policies like simplified issue or guaranteed issue may be an option. However, these policies tend to have higher premiums and lower coverage amounts.</p><h3 class="faq-question">How do I choose the right type of life insurance?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Consider your financial goals, coverage needs, budget, and any current or potential health issues.

While Edward Jones CD rates go up to 5.35% APY, Ally pays 3.00% to 4.50% APY. While these are still competitive rates overall, you can find higher rates at Edward Jones and elsewhere.</p><p>One thing Ally Bank does have going for it is its wide range of CD terms and options. The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/ally-cd-review">Ally High Yield CD</a> has terms from three months to five years. The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/ally-cd-review">Ally Raise Your Rate CD</a> comes with a two-year or four-year term. These allow you to increase your rate once (on two-year CDs) or twice (on four-year ones) over the course of your term. Ally also has no-penalty CDs, though Edward Jones brokered CDs have no penalties either (except for the potential loss that could come with selling your CD early).</p><p>Ally Bank CDs also compound interest daily, while Edward Jones CDs don&#39;t compound interest at all. Ally offers 24/7 customer service.</p><p><em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/ally-bank-review">Ally Bank Review</a></em></p><p><strong>Edward Jones CDs vs. Capital One 360 CDs</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/capital-one-cd-rates">Capital One CD rates</a> are also lower than Edward Jones&#39; rates. Capital One 360 CDs pay 3.90% to 5.10% APY. These are high compared to the national average, but lower than the best CD rates right now.</p><p>A standout feature of Capital One 360 CDs, though, is that it has a $0 minimum deposit requirement. (Remember, Edward Jones CDs require at least $1,000.) Interest also compounds monthly, and Capital One 360 has 24/7 customer support. But early withdrawal penalties range from three to six months of interest.</p><p><em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/capital-one-bank-review">Capital One 360 Bank Review</a></em></p><h3 data-toc-label="Why You Should Trust Us">Why You Should Trust Us: How We Reviewed Edward Jones CDs</h3><p>To review Edward Jones CDs, we used Business Insider&#39;s <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-we-rate-cds-certificates-of-deposit">certificate of deposit methodology</a>, which considers interest rates, minimum deposit requirements, CD term variety, the company&#39;s overall ethics, mobile app quality, and customer service.

You may be able to snag one of the highest rates out there&nbsp; &mdash; but Charles Schwab CDs don&#39;t <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-compound-interest">compound interest</a>.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="faq-question">Are Charles Schwab CDs FDIC-insured?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Yes, all Charles Schwab brokered CDs are bought through <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/fdic">FDIC</a>-insured banking institutions. This means up to $250,000 is protected at each individual bank.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="faq-question">How are Charles Schwab CDs different from other CDs?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Charles Schwab CDs are brokered CDs, which means buying one lets you open CDs from several banks at once. Brokered CDs tend to have higher interest rates and more flexibility than traditional CDs, as you can sell them at any time. They do not compound interest; when interest is paid, it is deposited into your Schwab brokerage account.</p><h3 class="faq-question">What is the minimum deposit for a Charles Schwab CD?</h3><p class="faq-answer">You&#39;ll need to deposit at least $1,000 to open a Charles Schwab CD.&nbsp;</p><h3 data-toc-label="How Charles Schwab CD Rates Compare">How Charles Schwab CD Rates Compare</h3><p><strong>Charles Schwab CDs vs. Synchrony Bank CDs</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/synchrony-bank-cd-rates">Synchrony Bank CD rates</a> are lower than those offered by Charles Schwab. At Synchrony, rates range from 0.25% to 5.25% APY, depending on the type of CD and its term length.</p><p>To be clear, we&#39;re not exactly comparing apples to apples. Synchrony Bank offers traditional CDs, which means you&#39;re only able to purchase CDs from Synchrony &mdash; not several CDs from different institutions at once. Still, Synchrony&#39;s CDs do compound interest daily, while Schwab&#39;s don&#39;t compound interest at all. This could make a big difference in your account&#39;s long-term earning potential.</p><p>Synchrony offers more variety than Schwab. There are no-penalty CDs, bump-up CDs, and terms range from three months up to five years. There is also a $0 minimum deposit, so you can get started with whatever cash you have on hand.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/synchrony-bank-review">Synchrony Bank Review</a></p><p><strong>Charles Schwab CDs vs. Discover Bank CDs</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/discover-cd-review">Discover® Bank (FDIC Insured) CD rates</a> are lower than Charles Schwab&#39;s, with rates ranging from 2.00% to 4.70% APY. They charge early withdrawal penalties that range from three months of interest on shorter-term CDs to up to 24 months of interest on longer terms. Discover also requires a higher minimum deposit ($2,500 versus Schwab&#39;s $1,000).&nbsp;</p><p>That said, Discover has traditional CDs, not brokered ones. As a result, it compounds interest daily &mdash; as opposed to Schwab, which does not compound interest.</p><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/discover-bank-review">Discover Bank Review</a></p><aside class="quick-tip headline-regular ignore-typography"><p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> Charles Schwab CD rates are much higher than the national average. They&#39;re brokered CDs, which means you can open accounts with different institutions and sell them if you need access to your money early. In some cases, CD rates through Charles Schwab are even higher than the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/who-has-the-best-cd-rates-right-now">best CD rates</a> at traditional banks and credit unions &mdash; but unlike traditional CDs, brokered CDs don&#39;t compound interest.

(Although we eliminated the early withdrawal category for Charles Schwab, since brokered CDs don&#39;t charge these penalties.) We also looked at the institution&#39;s overall ethics, quality of its mobile app, and customer service. Then we gave the CD a rating between 0 and 5.</p><div class="read-original">Read the original article on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/charles-schwab-cd-rates">Business Insider</a></div>]]></content:encoded>

See <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/personal-finance-editorial-standards" class="not-content-link" target="_blank">how we rate products and services</a> to help you make smart decisions with your money.</p><p>The best identity theft protection service is the one that meets your needs at a price you can afford. For example, if your identity has been stolen before, you&#39;re more likely to be targeted again. You may need to arm yourself more heavily than you would otherwise with features like dark web monitoring, public records monitoring, and identity theft recovery.</p><p>On the other hand, if you&#39;re concerned about your children, consider looking for identity protection that offers features for children. Most identity theft protection services in our guide provide features specifically for children, like Aura&#39;s hate speech monitoring or IdentityForce&#39;s Childwatch, which includes social media monitoring and Child Credit Activity Monitoring.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Best identity theft protection"><strong>Our top picks for the best identity theft protection</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Best overall:</strong> Norton 360 with LifeLock Select</li><li><strong>Best for families:</strong> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/aura-identity-theft-protection-review">Aura &ndash; All-In-One ID Theft Protection</a></li><li><strong>Best for complete coverage:</strong> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/identityforce-review">IdentityForce UltraSecure+Credit</a></li><li><strong>Most well-rounded:</strong> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/idshield-identity-theft-protection-review">IDShield 3 Bureau Individual Plan</a></li><li><strong>Most flexibility:</strong> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/identity-guard-identity-theft-protection-review">Identity Guard</a></li><li><strong>Best for basic coverage:</strong> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/privacyguard-identity-protection-review">PrivacyGuard Identity Protection</a></li></ul><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-identity-theft-protection-services#how-we-review-identity-theft-protection-services">How we rank identity theft protection services »</a></p><h2 data-toc-label="Best overall">Compare the top identity theft protection services</h2><p>The best identity theft protection is a service that meets your needs at the price you&#39;re willing to pay. While our system for rating these services is more nuanced than this, at the core of our rating system is the balance between the features provided and the cost of those features.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are the best identity theft protection services as picked by Business Insider editors in 2024.&nbsp;</p><h3 data-toc-label="Best overall">Best overall: <strong>Norton 360 with LifeLock Select</strong></h3><p><strong>Cost:&nbsp;</strong>$17.99 monthly or $179.99 annually</p><p>LifeLock is an identity theft protection service operated by Norton, one of the leading brands in cybersecurity. Unfortunately, LifeLock falls short compared to the other products included in this guide. However, the service gains a lot of value when paired with Norton 360, Norton&#39;s cybersecurity protection plan.&nbsp;</p><p>Norton 360 with LifeLock offers three plans: Standard, Advantage, and Ultimate Plus. The Standard plan offers the most value for its price and a sizable first-year discount. However, for more serious identity protection, it may be worth upgrading to one of the advanced plans.&nbsp;</p><p>You can read our <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/lifelock-identity-theft-protection-review">LifeLock review</a> here.&nbsp;</p><h3 data-toc-label="Best for complete coverage">Best for complete coverage: <strong><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/identityforce-review">IdentityForce UltraSecure+Credit</a></strong></h3><p><strong>Cost:&nbsp;</strong>$29.95 monthly or $299.50 annually</p><p>Ultra Secure+Credit is a product of TransUnion, but the +Credit plan also covers Experian and Equifax. It offers broad monitoring capability, including social media accounts, mobile device scanning, and dark web data analysis. It can also alert you of suspicious activity in your banking and investment accounts, in addition to credit-related fraud alerts.</p><p>On top of monitoring, Ultra Secure+Credit also offers cybersecurity features such as an online vault for storing sensitive digital documents and a VPN. Ultra Secure+Credit also offers an entry-level plan with most of the same features apart from credit monitoring, which is a good fit for anyone who already has that base covered.</p><p>While standard pricing is $29.95 a month, you can rummage around online for IdentityForce discounts. In the past, we&#39;ve found lower prices by Googling &#34;IdentityForce discount.&#34;</p><p>You can find our <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/identityforce-review">IdentityForce review</a> here.</p><h3 data-toc-label="Best for value">Best for value: <strong><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/idshield-identity-theft-protection-review">IDShield 3 Bureau Individual Plan</a></strong></h3><p><strong> Cost:</strong>&nbsp;Starting at $14.95/month</p><p>IDShield offers comparable protection to Ultra Secure+Credit at a lower price if you&#39;re paying monthly. You&#39;ll get all the essentials like three-bureau credit monitoring, alerts, and various cybersecurity and device protection tools. The few features IDShield lacks (like junk mail removal) aren&#39;t essential, so going without them is a reasonable tradeoff if cost is a priority.</p><p>One negative of IDShield is that it tends to get lower marks for its interface; if that deters you from using the security features, then whatever you save in monthly fees is nullified. IDShield is a well-rounded plan, but you should test it out with the 30-day free trial.</p><p>You can find our <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/idshield-identity-theft-protection-review">IDShield review</a> here.</p><h3 data-toc-label="Best for families">Best for families: <strong><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/aura-identity-theft-protection-review">Aura &ndash; All-In-One ID Theft Protection</a></strong></h3><p><strong>Cost:&nbsp;</strong>$15 monthly or $144 annually</p><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/aura-identity-theft-protection-review">Aura</a> provides fewer monitoring services than Ultra Secure+Credit and IDShield &mdash; it doesn&#39;t include social media, for example. It still offers well-rounded protection with monitoring of all three credit bureaus and the standard security tools, as well as email aliases to reduce spam and exposure to data breaches.</p><p>Aura All-In-One shines brightest with its couple and family plans, which provide the same protections for additional members (children or adults) at a heavily discounted cost per person. Aura&#39;s family plan also offers parental controls for mobile devices.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find our <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/aura-identity-theft-protection-review">Aura review</a> here.</p><h3 data-toc-label="Best for flexibility">Best for flexibility: <strong><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/identity-guard-identity-theft-protection-review">Identity Guard</a></strong></h3><p><strong>Cost:</strong> $8.99 to $29.99 monthly for individuals, $14.99 to $39.99 monthly for families</p><p>Owned by Aura, Identity Guard has three core plans: Value, Total, and Ultra. With a family version for each of these tiers, Identity Guard has six plans overall. Even without the annual discounts applied, Identity Guard&#39;s Value plan is the cheapest service on this list. Its more expensive plans are still competitively priced compared to other services on this list, though you&#39;ll get a much better deal if you commit to an annual plan.&nbsp;</p><p>One thing to note is that Identity Guard reserves its White Glove fraud resolution service for its Ultra plan, significantly reducing the utility of the Value and Total plans.</p><p>You can find our <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/identity-guard-identity-theft-protection-review">Identity Guard review</a> here.&nbsp;</p><h3 data-toc-label="Best for basic coverage">Best for basic coverage: <strong><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/privacyguard-identity-protection-review">PrivacyGuard Identity Protection</a></strong></h3><p><strong>Cost:</strong> $9.99 per month</p><p>PrivacyGuard has some gaps in its <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-to-get-identity-theft-protection">identity theft protection</a>. Notably, its credit monitoring feature is a completely separate plan from its identity theft coverage unless you purchase the most expensive bundle. However, we&#39;re just recommending the identity protection service alone, as you can fill its credit monitoring gap using other tools that are available for free.</p><p>PrivacyGuard provides many services that are harder to replicate without paying, like dark web scanning and public records monitoring at lower prices than its competitors. You&#39;ll also get tools to secure your browser and keyboard. PrivacyGuard also provides bank account and credit card monitoring, which are surprisingly scarce features among identity protection services.</p><p>You can find our <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/privacyguard-identity-protection-review">PrivacyGuard review</a> here.&nbsp;</p><h2>Identity theft protection cost</h2><p>The monthly cost of the identity protection services on this list ranges from $12 to $29.95 for their individual plans, though you can find services with prices outside this range on either end. Some of these services will offer family plans at a discounted rate.</p><aside class="quick-tip headline-regular ignore-typography"><p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>The median loss to fraud in 2023 was $500, <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/CSN-Annual-Data-Book-2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to reports from the FTC</a>.</p></aside><p>Protecting your identity and other sensitive personal information is like protecting your home against fire. Most houses have fire prevention measures baked into their design, including fire-resistant materials, landscaping precautions, and fire hydrant access. You should have early detection and alert systems like smoke, heat, or flame detectors and suppression systems like fire extinguishers and sprinklers. Hopefully, you observe basic fire safety protocols like storing flammable materials properly and not leaving open flames unattended. Finally, you should have fire insurance&nbsp;to protect yourself financially.</p><p>None of those measures guarantees your house won&#39;t catch fire, but collectively, they mitigate the risk and extent of fire damage. Similarly, identity theft protection doesn&#39;t guarantee your personal information will remain secure, but it reduces the likelihood you&#39;ll experience the worst outcomes of having your identity stolen.&nbsp;</p><p>Like fire protection, identity theft protection isn&#39;t a single measure but an array of complementary measures designed to safeguard your personal information.</p><h2>Types of identity theft protection</h2><p>Standard features offered by identity theft protection companies generally fit into one of the following three categories:</p><ul><li><strong>Monitoring and alerts </strong>&mdash; Given how quickly identity thieves put stolen data to ill use, early detection and warning are critical to minimizing damage. Identity theft detection companies monitor your personal information for suspicious activity and notify you when something is amiss. What you get varies among companies and plans but usually includes monitoring of credit reports, social security numbers, property and court records, and more.</li><li><strong>Security tools</strong> &mdash; While security measures aren&#39;t foolproof, your data is less vulnerable with some of the features that identity theft protection services offer. This includes tools like antivirus and malware protection, a virtual private network (VPN) for safe browsing, and password management.</li><li><strong>Recovery </strong>&mdash; When your personal information has been compromised, identity theft protection can help you limit further damage by freezing your credit and exposed accounts. It can also help you <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-to-recover-from-identity-theft">recover your identity</a> and cover related expenses, though it&#39;s unlikely to reimburse direct losses resulting from fraud.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Identity theft protection and credit monitoring</h3><p>One identity protection feature to prioritize is reporting from all three <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-bureau-experian-equifax-transunion">major credit bureaus</a>; many entry-level plans only monitor one bureau, leaving room for suspicious activity to slip through unnoticed. You should also look for a service that gets audited regularly by independent security experts and deletes your information when you cancel your subscription (rather than holding onto it indefinitely).</p><aside class="breakout-box headline-regular ignore-typography"><p><strong>Identity Theft in the US</strong></p><p>In 2023, the Federal Trade Commission logged over 1 million reports of identity theft, 100,000 fewer reports than in 2022. That figure only includes what gets reported &mdash; the true number of identity theft cases is likely much higher.&nbsp;</p><p>Identity theft risk often varies by where you live. Georgia has the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/identity-theft-by-state">highest rate of identity theft</a> among any state, in both 2022 and 2023.</p></aside><h2>How to report identity theft</h2><p>If you suspect your identity has been stolen, your first action should be to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-to-freeze-your-credit">freeze your credit reports</a> to prevent the thief from applying for credit in your name. It&#39;s free and won&#39;t damage your credit. You can always unfreeze your reports later when the dust settles.&nbsp;</p><p>Your next steps to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-to-report-identity-theft">reporting identity theft</a> depend on the nature of the identity theft and any fraud that may have already occurred:</p><ul><li><strong>File an identity theft report:</strong> <a href="https://www.identitytheft.gov/#/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored">IdentityTheft.gov</a> is a Federal Trade Commission program that will help you create a recovery plan and generate an identity theft report that you can use later as documentation. You can file a report over the phone at 877-438-4338, though you won&#39;t receive that identity theft report.</li><li><strong>Report the fraud to involved companies: </strong>Notify any banks, credit card issuers, or other companies involved in your identity theft case. The sooner you do this, the better. If you don&#39;t report within a certain timeframe, you could be liable for any debts incurred.</li><li><strong>Notify the credit bureaus:</strong> Call at least one of the main credit bureaus to let them know your identity has been stolen. The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/fair-credit-reporting-act-fcra">Fair Credit Reporting Act</a> requires credit bureaus to notify the others, and you&#39;ll receive a 90-day initial <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-to-place-fraud-alert">fraud alert</a>, which means creditors have to take reasonable steps to verify the identity of anyone applying for credit under your name. Later, with an identity theft report, you can extend the fraud alert to seven years.</li><li><strong>Contact law enforcement:</strong> Depending on the situation, you may want to file a police report, especially if you know who stole your identity. Some creditors may also require you to file a report with law enforcement.</li></ul><p>If your Social Security number has been compromised, and you continue to have issues with identity theft, you may be eligible to <a href="https://faq.ssa.gov/en-us/Topic/article/KA-02220" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored">get a new Social Security number</a>. However, the requirements for a new Social Security number are high. You need to have been repeatedly targeted by identity thieves or in situations of harassment, abuse, or life endangerment. You&#39;ll need to contact your local Social Security office and arrange an in-person appointment.</p><h2>How to prevent identity theft</h2><p>While an identity protection service will make it harder for hackers and identity thieves to use your identity, Eva Velasquez, founder and CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center, says that &#34;hiring a service does not mean you can or should abdicate all responsibility for good identity and cyber hygiene.&#34; She says that many financial organizations may refuse to reimburse victims if they determine the victims didn&#39;t take sufficient care of their credentials and accounts.</p><p>Because identity theft is often a crime of opportunity, taking steps to reduce the risk of identity theft can go a long way toward preventing it entirely. You can do a lot to protect your personal information by practicing good data hygiene and staying vigilant about how your information is used and distributed. Simple steps like using strong passwords and antivirus software, securing your mail, and regularly reviewing account statements for suspicious activity will help you prevent and detect identity theft.</p><p>You can also look into various products beyond identity theft protection to prevent identity theft. You ask the credit bureaus to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-to-freeze-your-credit">freeze your credit</a>&nbsp;or place a fraud alert on your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-credit-report">credit reports</a>, preventing identity thieves from borrowing money using your credit. These are free services offered by credit bureaus.</p><p>Those practices, combined with well-rounded identity theft protection, will significantly reduce the risk of having your personal information compromised.</p><h2 data-toc-label="How we review identity theft protection services">How we review identity theft protection services</h2><p>We interviewed identity theft experts to inform our picks for the best identity protection services. These answers have been edited for concision. Here&#39;s what they had to say:</p><p><strong>Is it worth it?</strong></p><p><strong>Eva Velasquez, CEO and president of the Identity Theft Resource Center:</strong></p><p>Paid identity protection services can have value for individuals and families that have the financial means to pay for the services. These services can take some of the leg work out of monitoring your identity and the recovery process should an identity crime occur. I often use the analogy of hiring a pet groomer or grooming my dog myself. I can bathe and groom my dog for &#34;free,&#34; but I do have to consider the cost of the shampoo, tools, water, and my time versus hiring someone to do it for me. Both are legitimate ways to meet the need but depend on my personal preference.</p><p>Before you purchase, make sure that you don&#39;t already have this benefit available to you. Some homeowners or renters insurance plans have riders that provide this coverage. Some employers offer these services as an employee benefit for free or at a discount. Some membership organizations you already belong to may also offer this as a benefit at a reduced cost.</p><p><strong>Jeanne Kelly, credit coach and founder of The Kelly Group:</strong></p><p>Absolutely. It is crucial to recognize that even if you are cautious about sharing your personal information, it is still stored in various databases, such as those of financial institutions, schools, and medical offices. Therefore, having identity theft protection ensures that you are promptly alerted in case of any issues and provides professional assistance in restoring your identity.</p><p><strong>Paul Kim, associate editor of credit scores at Business Insider:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Identity protection can be a nice thing to have for peace of mind. However, most people don&#39;t need to spring for the fanciest, most expensive plan out there. Some of the cheaper plans, plus a little vigilance on your part, will often do the trick.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How do I determine the level of identity protection I need?</strong></p><p><strong>Velasquez:</strong></p><p>Ask yourself the following questions: How many people do I intend to cover? What are the ages of the individuals needing services? Do they have access to, and can they make effective use of digital platforms? How digitally engaged are they? Make sure you purchase coverage that meets your individual needs.</p><p>For example, if you purchase a family plan with features including cyberbullying monitoring, is that something you currently need? Are your children of an age that they are engaged online, and this feature is helpful? If you have plans available through an employee benefits program or insurance policy, ask your benefits administrator or insurance broker for assistance in determining the level of coverage that is most suitable for you.</p><p><strong>Kelly:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Conduct thorough research to understand the available options. It is not sufficient to rely solely on receiving alerts. It is essential to find an identity theft protection service that not only notifies you but also offers robust support in resolving identity theft issues. Think of it as having an alarm system that also sends help when triggered. Look for services that provide the expertise of private investigators to assist you throughout the identity restoration process.</p><p><strong>Kim:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>When shopping for identity protection, you should think about how much of a risk identity theft poses. Obviously, everyone can be targeted, but some people are at higher risk. Certain <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/identity-theft-by-state">states have higher rates of identity theft</a> than others. Additionally, people who were victims of identity theft are more likely to be targeted than those who have never had their identities stolen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What are the most important identity theft protection features?</strong></p><p><strong>Velasquez:</strong></p><p>Transparency. This is an individual choice. The important features are going to vary based on the individual. However, a service that is transparent about what it covers and what it does not is key. Make sure you read all the information to understand what is covered, how the service is provided, and the limitations of the service, if any. Read the terms of any insurance plans carefully and ensure you understand what losses are actually covered and what your duty of care or other obligations are to seek reimbursement for losses.</p><p><strong>Kelly:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>One crucial feature is the ability to grant power of attorney or authorization for someone else to handle the intricate process of restoring your identity. Dealing with identity theft can be incredibly time-consuming, often requiring hundreds of hours. By having experts handle the work on your behalf, you can save valuable time and ensure that the restoration process is handled effectively. It is crucial to proactively obtain identity theft protection before any issues arise.</p><p><strong>Kim:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Two features I look out for are dark web monitoring and court records monitoring because it&#39;s difficult to replicate these yourself. If you&#39;re looking for basic identity protection that may not offer every type of monitoring, ensure that the service will at least monitor the dark web and court records.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What makes an identity theft protection service good?</strong></p><p><strong>Velasquez:</strong></p><p>In addition to my response above, also read consumer reviews and look at third-party accreditation sites such as the Better Business Bureau. Reading reviews will allow you to determine if there is a pattern of behavior that demonstrates poor customer experience. While no company is going to be perfect, seeing how they resolve customer complaints and issues will be useful in making your determination to do business with them.</p><p><strong>Kelly:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A good identity theft protection service should monitor multiple aspects of your identity, including your social security number, driver&#39;s license, passport ID, medical card, social media accounts, and address changes with the postal service. Remember, identity theft encompasses more than just credit-related fraud. For instance, if someone gains access to your medical ID or driver&#39;s license number, they can exploit it to receive medical services or cash checks under your identity. Therefore, ensure that the service you choose monitors these essential areas. Additionally, in the event of an identity theft incident, make sure the service provides comprehensive support for identity restoration.</p><p><strong>Kim:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The identity protection services I pay particular attention to will offer solutions for the before, during, and after of identity theft. So, it&#39;ll offer features that protect your identity before any theft occurs, like cybersecurity measures and VPNs. The identity protection service will also provide identity monitoring to alert you when identity theft occurs. Lastly, a good identity protection service will have restoration experts who will guide you through the process of recovering your identity. Ideally, they&#39;ll do most of the work for you.</p><h3>How we rate identity theft protection services</h3><p>We rate services on a scale from one to five stars, with five being the highest. We apply these ratings to the overall service and the individual plans it offers.&nbsp;</p><h4>Provided features (45%)</h4><p>Most identity theft protection services will boast a long list of features that they provide. You will likely never notice some of these features running in the background, such as home title monitoring. Others, you&#39;ll be able to achieve for free elsewhere, such as <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-to-freeze-your-credit">credit freezes</a>.</p><p>When we look at a service&#39;s features, we pay attention to particular features that make or break a protection service. We also look at any unique features that a service provides, making it stand out from other services.</p><h4><strong>Fraud resolution (20%)</strong></h4><p>Identity monitoring matters little if a service doesn&#39;t also provide tools to help you <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-to-recover-from-identity-theft">recover your identity</a>. That&#39;s why it&#39;s so important that your identity theft protection service has some form of fraud resolution. Many services also offer lost wallet protection, which assists you in making all the necessary cancellations and replacements that come with losing your wallet or having it stolen.</p><p>Ideally, a service will provide a fraud resolution expert dedicated to your profile if dealing with a stolen identity. This person will help you navigate the process of recovering your identity and assets. They&#39;ll also help you contact the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-bureau-experian-equifax-transunion">three major credit bureaus</a> and any other involved parties to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-to-report-identity-theft">report identity theft</a>.</p><p>It&#39;s also important to ensure that your identity theft protection service has some form of identity insurance that will help you cover any monetary losses due to fraud.</p><h4><strong>Dark web and court records monitoring (10%)</strong></h4><p>While some features that identity theft protection services perform can be done on your own or found in other services, dark web monitoring and court records monitoring are particularly hard to find elsewhere.</p><p>Dark web monitoring scans the dark web (which you likely do not know how to access) to see if anyone is selling your personal information. Court records monitoring scans public records for your information in case anyone has given your information in their criminal case.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Credit monitoring capabilities (5%)</strong></h4><p>Credit monitoring is a cornerstone of all identity theft protection services, alerting you of any changes to your credit report. Any unexpected updates in your credit report, like a new <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-line-of-credit">line of credit</a>, are likely signs of identity theft.&nbsp;</p><p>While the presence of credit monitoring capabilities is important in securing your identity, we&#39;ve deprioritized it in our ratings. This is because you can find free credit monitoring services that will provide you with the same monitoring and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-credit-report">credit reports</a> that you&#39;d pay for with some of these services. You can also request a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-to-get-free-credit-report">free credit report</a> weekly from each of the three credit bureaus.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find our list of the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-credit-monitoring-services">best credit monitoring services</a> here.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Unique features (10%)</strong></h4><p>The truth of identity protection is that most services are very similar to each other in what they offer. What distinguishes certain services are standouts that catch our eye.</p><p>For example, PrivacyGuard identity theft protection service includes a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-a-credit-score">credit score</a> simulator, which will give you a rough estimate of how your <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/why-did-credit-score-drop">credit score will change</a> with certain actions, such as a new loan. More cybersecurity-focused services, will include a VPN, secured document storage, and anti-malware protection.</p><p>Some services that offer family plans will also have parental features, such as social media monitoring. Some services will also monitor your children&#39;s online activity for cyberbullying or hate speech. Other plans, such as <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/identity-guard-identity-theft-protection-review">Identity Guard</a>, feature an optimized mobile experience, providing users with peace of mind while on the go.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h4>Price of service (45%)</h4><p><strong>Tiered plans (35%)</strong></p><p>Ultimately, many identity theft protection services offer very similar features. Because so many services often perform very similar functions, the main distinguishing factor between these services is how much they cost. Many services will spread their array of features across different plans that get progressively more expensive the more protection it offers.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, many services will include credit monitoring for one bureau in their basic tier and reserve three-bureau monitoring for their premium tier. Other services may give you dark web monitoring in the basic tier but withhold court records monitoring for higher tiers.</p><p>We prefer services that include their entire catalog of features in one overarching plan, like Aura identity theft protection. However, this doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that tiered services are bad. If you only need to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-to-reduce-identity-theft-risk">reduce the risk of identity theft</a> to a certain level, there&#39;s no need to pay a premium price when the basic plan will suffice.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Group plans (10%)</strong></p><p>Family plans and couples plans will give you and your loved ones the same level of protection for a discounted price. These services, such as those offered by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/identityiq-identity-theft-protection-review">IdentityIQ</a>, also come with family-specific features tailored to monitoring your children&#39;s identity and online activity.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Customer support (10%)</strong></p><p>While price and features are the two most important factors we use to judge an identity theft protection service, we also recognize these services as businesses that need to be responsive to their customers.&nbsp;</p><p>When we talk about customer support, we&#39;re looking aspects like cancellation policies, annual membership discounts, and free trials.&nbsp;We also look at a business&#39;s Better Business Bureau score to evaluate how they respond to customer complaints.&nbsp;</p><p>We also look to see if there are any necessary qualifications to enroll in a service. Some <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/identity-theft-fraud-protection-programs-credit-cards">credit cards have identity theft protection</a>&nbsp;that are only available to their cardholders, such as American Express CreditSecure. Another example is Complete ID, which is only available to Costco members.</p><h3>What to know about identity theft protection service ratings</h3><p>Our system for rating identity theft protection services balances the price of the service with the features that the service provides. It also acknowledges that these services are businesses that must be responsive to customers.&nbsp;</p><p>While we can analyze these services on a tangible, quantifiable level, the best identity theft protection service is one that you&#39;ll actually use. A service may not have the most features, but if that service inspires you to be more proactive about protecting your information, that&#39;s a selling point. The next step is finding out <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-to-get-identity-theft-protection">how to get identity theft protection</a>&nbsp;that works for you.</p><p>Included in our guide on the best identity theft protection services is our expert panel, consisting of experts in identity theft protection and credit. Eva Velasquez, CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center and one of the members of our expert panel, recommends considering several questions about your specific situation. You should consider how many people you&#39;re covering, their ages, and how digitally engaged they are. &#34;Make sure you purchase coverage that meets your individual needs,&#34; Velasquez says.</p><h2 data-toc-label="FAQs">FAQs</h2><h3 class="faq-question">Is identity theft protection worth it?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Identity theft protection services can protect you from fraud that can cost you thousands of dollars.&nbsp; If your identity is stolen, you can lose money and time and may find it really difficult to obtain loans, credit cards, and other financial products.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="faq-question">How does a customer benefit from identity protection services?&nbsp;</h3><p class="faq-answer">Identity theft services can help with the financial costs associated with identity theft incidents.

See <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/personal-finance-editorial-standards#rating-banking-product" class="not-content-link" target="_blank">how we rate banking products</a> to write unbiased product reviews.</p><p>High-yield savings accounts and traditional savings accounts work in much the same way. They both offer a variable interest rate on your money, which means the interest rate can change over time. Where they differ is in how high that interest rate is: high-yield savings accounts generally offer a much higher rate than brick-and-mortar savings accounts do. We report on the best rates that banks and credit unions offer on high-yield savings accounts. All of the institutions on this list offer at least 4.75% APY (Annual Percentage Yield), significantly higher than the national average.</p><h2>Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Today</h2><p>We monitor rates daily to find the best high-interest savings accounts in three categories &mdash; the best rates overall, accounts that let you earn a high rate with minimal effort (like low minimum deposits and balance requirements), and high rates with popular brands. We have also included a market leader so you know the highest savings rate available throughout local financial institutions.&nbsp;</p><p>Our top picks for savings accounts are federally insured by the FDIC or NCUA. Federal insurance protects up to $250,000 per depositor in the event of a bank failure.</p><aside class="quick-tip headline-regular ignore-typography"><p>High-yield savings accounts can typically be found at online banks or credit unions.

You can earn 6.17% APY on balances up to $1,000. If you have an account balance above $1,000, the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-interest">interest</a>&nbsp;rate drops to 0.15% APY. This account doesn&#39;t charge monthly service fees.</p><p>To open the Digital Federal Credit Union Primary Savings Account, you&#39;ll have to meet certain membership eligibility requirements. You must live in select areas of Massachusetts, live in a New Hampshire participating condominium community, work for a Select Employer Group, or belong to a local participating organization.&nbsp;</p><p>Digital Federal Credit Union currently has an <a href="https://www.bbb.org/us/ma/marlborough/profile/credit-union/digital-federal-credit-union-0021-86036" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A+ rating</a> from the BBB.

When choosing an account, make sure you can afford the minimum deposit. You should also check whether there is a monthly service fee &mdash; and if so, find out if you qualify to waive it &mdash; or any requirements to earn the highest interest rate. Some institutions also limit the number of monthly withdrawals/transfers you can make from your high-yield savings account before charging you a fee. You want an account that will result in a high interest rate and few to no fees so you can earn as much as possible. You&#39;ll also want to consider accounts tailored to your specific circumstances; for example, if you&#39;re in the military, you might want a savings account from one of the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-banks-and-credit-unions-military-and-families#:~:text=USAA%20is%20one%20of%20the,indicating%20this%20redirects%20the%20user.%22&amp;text=Show%20Pros%2C%20Cons%2C%20and%20More,-Navy%20Federal%20Credit">best military banks</a>.</p><h2>High Interest Savings Account Interest Rate Facts</h2><p>Generally, you&#39;ll find the best nationwide savings interest rates at online banks. That said, a local credit union currently offers the highest interest rate on a savings account overall. You may get 6.17% APY on up to $1,000 in your savings if you join Digital Federal Credit Union. Membership, however, is limited to people who live in select areas of Massachusetts, live in a New Hampshire participating condominium community, work for a Select Employer Group, or belong to a local participating organization.&nbsp;</p><h3>How Savings Accounts Work</h3><p>A savings account is a type of interest-earning bank account. A savings account rate is variable, which means it can fluctuate after it is opened. Your bank will usually email you to tell you the rate will go up or down soon.</p><p>Savings accounts may also have transfer limits, according to federal rule Regulation D. Generally, if a savings account has a transfer limit, this means that you&#39;ll only be permitted to make six transfers from the account each month. If you exceed the transfer limit, you will have to pay a fee for each additional transfer.</p><p>The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve has recently <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/caletters/caltr2106.htm#:~:text=On%20April%2028%2C%202020%2C%20the,the%20%E2%80%9Csavings%20deposit%E2%80%9D%20definition." target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="40" data-uri="c129925cb7b8597645955773d52a914e">amended Regulation D</a>, so banks may choose to suspend the monthly transfer limit so customers can make unlimited monthly transactions, or they could enforce a six-per-month limit.</p><h3>Typical Interest Rates on High-Yield Savings Accounts</h3><p>The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/average-savings-account-interest-rate">average savings account</a> in the United States offers 0.46% APY as of April 2024.</p><p>If you&#39;re more comfortable banking with a brick-and-mortar bank, a traditional savings account might be a better option for you. Just know that you may not be getting the best possible interest rate because online banks and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-credit-unions">credit unions</a>&nbsp;usually offer higher rates.</p><h3>High-Yield Savings Account Fees</h3><p>Depending on where you bank, some savings accounts may charge <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/monthly-bank-maintenance-fee">monthly bank maintenance fees</a>. A monthly service fee is an amount you&#39;ll have to pay each month to maintain an account. Some accounts will allow you to waive a monthly service fee if you meet certain requirements while others cannot be waived. Bear in mind that some savings accounts do not charge certain fees at all.</p><h3>The Different Types of Savings Accounts</h3><p>There are six <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/types-of-savings-accounts">types of savings accounts</a>: traditional savings accounts, high-yield savings accounts, money market accounts, certificates of deposit, cash management accounts, and specialty savings accounts. The best savings account for you may depend on your banking preference, goals, and when you&#39;ll need to access your money.</p><p>A high-yield savings account, for example, is a strong choice if you&#39;re comfortable with banking digitally and want to obtain a high interest rate.</p><h2>Maximizing Your Earnings with High-Yield Savings Accounts</h2><p>To maximize your earnings with a high-yield savings account, shop around to find one that pays a high rate and doesn&#39;t charge monthly service or excess withdrawal fees for taking money out regularly. You may find it helpful to set up automatic transfers from your checking account to your high-yield savings account. If you receive your paycheck as a direct deposit, you can also ask your employer to send a percentage of your paycheck to your high-yield savings account each pay period. As your balance grows with automatic savings and direct deposits, you&#39;ll earn more interest.</p><h3>What to Do When Your High-Yield Savings Account Rate Drops</h3><p>Interest rates on high-interest savings accounts closely follow the federal funds rate. This means rates are variable and can change several times per year at the whim of the Federal Reserve. Savings rates may go up or <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/will-savings-rates-drop-after-next-fed-meeting">drop after a Fed meeting</a>.</p><p>If the interest rate on your savings account drops significantly, you may decide to look at other financial institutions to see if you can find a more competitive interest rate elsewhere. However, bear in mind that changing accounts may not be worth the effort, particularly if your new account&#39;s rate drops afterward.</p><p>You also might consider other types of savings account options. For example, buying savings bonds or setting up a CD ladder may be worth considering if you&#39;ve already established your emergency fund.</p><h2>Alternatives to High-Yield Savings Accounts</h2><h3><strong>High-Yield Savings Accounts vs. CDs</strong></h3><p>The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/who-has-the-best-cd-rates-right-now">best CD rates</a> are comparable to the best high-yield savings account rates. You might prefer a CD if you want to lock in a high rate for a set period of time, because your rate is fixed. You won&#39;t risk your rate decreasing as you would with a savings account. But CDs offer less flexibility. You can&#39;t put in more money after the initial opening deposit, and you&#39;ll pay a penalty if you take out money before the term ends.</p><p>If you&#39;re trying to decide between <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/cds-vs-high-yield-savings">CDs versus high-yield savings</a> accounts, your choice could come down to when you need to deposit and/or withdraw money.</p><h3><strong>High-Yield Savings Accounts vs. Money Market Accounts</strong></h3><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-a-money-market-account">Money market accounts</a> are similar to high-yield savings accounts, but they typically make it easier to access your savings. The best money market accounts come with features checking accounts might have, such as an ATM card, debit card, or paper checks.</p><h3><strong>High-Yield Savings Accounts vs. High-Yield Checking Accounts</strong></h3><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-high-yield-checking-accounts">High-yield checking accounts</a> are great tools for earning even more interest on your money. But checking account balances are often lower than savings account balances because you use them to spend money. If you&#39;re serious about using interest to grow your balance, a high-yield savings account is usually the better bet.</p><h2 data-toc-label="FAQs">High-Yield Savings Account Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3 class="faq-question" data-pm-slice="1 1 []">What does APY mean?&nbsp;</h3><p class="faq-answer"><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-apy">APY</a> stands for annual percentage yield. The APY of a savings account will tell you how much money you&#39;ll earn in a year, factoring in compound interest.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="faq-question">What is the highest-paying high-yield savings account?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Digital Federal Credit Union currently offers the highest savings account rate right now, paying 6.17% APY on balances up to $1,000. Credit Union membership is limited to people who live in select areas of Massachusetts, live in a New Hampshire participating condominium community, work for a Select Employer Group, or belong to a local participating organization.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="faq-question">How high will savings interest rates go in 2024?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Savings account rates will likely be highest at the beginning of 2024, and comparable to current savings rates. However, the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/savings-rate-forecast-2024">savings rate forecast for 2024</a> also indicates rates are expected to drop in 2024 once the Federal Reserve begins to cut rates.</p><h3 class="faq-question" data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Can you lose money in a high-yield savings account?</h3><p class="faq-answer">It&#39;s safe to keep all of your money in a high-yield savings account if your balance is $250,000 or less (for an individual account) or $500,000 or less (in a joint account). The FDIC and NCUA insure up to $250,000 per owner, per category. So <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-happens-if-my-bank-fails">if your bank fails</a>, all of your insured money would be safe. If you have more than the FDIC or NCUA would insure, consider opening a second account at another institution or investing some money if it makes sense for you.</p><h3 class="faq-question">How much will $10,000 make in a high-yield savings account?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Many high-yield savings accounts offer an APY of 5% or higher. With a 5% APY, you would have $10,500 in your account at the end of one year.</p><h3 class="faq-question">Is it worth putting money into a high-yield savings account?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Yes; high-yield savings accounts are a great way to earn a high interest rate on your money while still being able to access it if you need to. Your money is also safe in a high-yield savings account, as it is FDIC-insured up to $250,000 for a single-owner bank account and $500,000 for a joint-owner account.</p><h3 class="faq-question">How much will $1,000 make in a high-yield savings account?</h3><p class="faq-answer">The best high-yield savings accounts pay at least 4.50% APY. In one year, 4.50% APY on $1,000 would add around $45 to your account.</p><h3 class="faq-question">Which bank has the best high-yield savings account?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Which bank offers the best high-yield savings account for you will largely depend on what you need from a bank. Currently, Digital Federal Credit Union offers the highest APY for a high-yield savings account, but it only offers that rate for the first $1,000 in the account. If you want to put more in your high-yield savings account, you might want to consider banks like Western Alliance Bank, BrioDirect, or TAB Bank.</p><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>Does the interest rate on my savings account change?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">Yes, the interest rate on your savings account will most likely change. Interest rates on savings accounts are variable, meaning they can and will change regularly and without advance notice. These fluctuations are based on the federal funds rate, which is set by the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-the-federal-reserve">Federal Reserve</a>.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Why You Should Trust Us">Why You Should Trust Us: Experts&#39; Advice on Choosing the Best High-Yield Savings Account</h2><p>We consulted banking and financial planning experts to inform these picks and provide their advice on finding the best high-yield savings accounts for your needs.</p><figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/65f30d7d3037f8e81750540e?format=jpeg" height="433" width="1200" charset="" alt="PFI Banking Expert Panel (updated Mar 2024); (from left to right) Tania Brown; Roger Ma; Sophia Acevedo; Mykail James"/><figcaption><p class="copyright">BI</p></figcaption></figure><ul data-stringify-type="unordered-list" data-indent="0"><li>Tania Brown, CFP, vice president of coaching strategy at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ofcolor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="100" data-mrf-link="https://www.ofcolor.com/">OfColor</a></li><li>Roger Ma, certified financial planner with <a href="https://www.lifelaidout.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-post-depth="20">lifelaidout®</a> and author of <span>&#34;Work Your Money, Not Your Life&#34;</span></li><li>Sophia Acevedo, banking editor,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-post-depth="100" data-uri="06d5d843a1e77bf6ad8215a6e4467c89" data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" data-mrf-link="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance">Business Insider</a></li><li>Mykail James, MBA, certified financial education instructor, <a href="https://www.boujiebudgets.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-post-depth="20">BoujieBudgets.com</a></li></ul><p>Here&#39;s what our expert panel had to say about high-interest savings accounts. (Some text may be lightly edited for clarity.)</p><p><strong>Generally, what makes a high-yield savings account good or not good?</strong></p><p><strong>Roger Ma, certified financial planner with <a href="https://www.lifelaidout.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-post-depth="100" data-uri="bbf682cdd410d88e2c3adca93d67b592" data-analytics-module="body_link">lifelaidout®</a> and author of<span>&#34;Work Your Money, Not Your Life&#34;</span>:</strong></p><p>&#34;It might not be as seamless to get your money out of an online savings account as it is a brick-and-mortar, but you don&#39;t want to have so much friction where it&#39;s such a pain to get the money out when you need it.&#34;</p><p><strong>Mykail James, MBA, certified financial education instructor, <a href="https://www.boujiebudgets.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-post-depth="100" data-uri="2cf30a6077693f0e2adb1334f9258693" data-analytics-module="body_link">BoujieBudgets.com</a>:</strong></p><p>&#34;Anything with a fee is not a good high-yield savings account. Anything that restricts how much you can save is, to me, not very good. If I can&#39;t save more than $10,000 in this account, and then I have to move it over somewhere else &mdash; to me, that&#39;s not a really good savings account, because it&#39;s not really prepared to help me expand and grow, which is what a savings account is supposed to do. I also look at interest rates, definitely. I look to see when the interest is paid. Is it quarterly, or is it monthly? How often do they pay out interest, and what are the interest rate stipulations?&#34;</p><p><strong>Sophia Acevedo, banking editor,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-post-depth="100" data-uri="06d5d843a1e77bf6ad8215a6e4467c89" data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" data-mrf-link="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance">Business Insider</a>:</strong></p><p>&#34;I would consider looking for features that will help manage your account. Some banks have high-yield savings accounts that let you separate your savings into individual goals and track your progress. Other financial institutions will let you deposit cash at ATMs or some retailers. A good high-yield savings account will likely be an account where you can grow your savings without unnecessary hassles.&#34;</p><p><strong>How should someone decide whether to put their money in a high-yield savings account, money market account, or CD?</strong></p><p><strong>Tania Brown, CFP, vice president of coaching strategy at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ofcolor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="100" data-mrf-link="https://www.ofcolor.com/">OfColor</a>:</strong></p><p>&#34;So I guess we&#39;ll start off with how much money you want to put in and the level of transactions you want to have. If you want to have any transactions, that automatically takes out CDs. Then you&#39;re stuck between the high-yield savings and the money market account.&#34;</p><p><strong>Sophia Acevedo, CEPF:</strong></p><p>&#34;I would create a list of what I prioritize most in a bank account. For example, some banks have accounts that charge monthly service fees. I would look to see what the requirements are for waiving the monthly service fee and whether I think I could feasibly meet those requirements each month. If I&#39;m searching for an interest-earning bank account, I&#39;ll pay attention to interest rates. I would make sure the account pays a higher interest rate than the average bank account.&#34;</p><h3><strong>Our Methodology: How We Chose the Best Savings Accounts</strong></h3><p>There are many high-yield savings accounts available across financial institutions. Through our research, we&#39;ve found that the best high-yield savings accounts are offered by banks with a strong online presence, robo-advisors, and other internet-only financial companies. If you&#39;re more comfortable banking with a national brick-and-mortar bank, you&#39;ll likely have to consider a premium savings account to earn a more competitive interest rate.</p><p>We review savings accounts at nearly three dozen institutions weekly to identify the strongest options. While interest rates are an important aspect of any savings account, we also consider minimum deposits and balance requirements, transfer limitations, and any other standout features.</p><p>At Business Insider, we aim to help smart people make the best decisions with their money. We understand that &#34;best&#34; is often subjective, so in addition to highlighting the clear benefits of a financial product or account &mdash; a high APY, for example &mdash; we outline the limitations, too. We spent hours comparing and contrasting the features and fine print of various products so you don&#39;t have to.</p><p><em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-we-rate-checking-savings-money-market-accounts">See our full ratings methodology for checking, business checking, savings, and money market accounts »</a></em></p><div class="read-original">Read the original article on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-high-yield-savings-accounts-rates-right-now">Business Insider</a></div>]]></content:encoded>

<li>Employers may offer free or low-cost supplemental life insurance for full-time employees.</li>
<li>It may cover things such as burial costs or accidental death and dismemberment.</li>
</ul><p>Supplemental life insurance, which is available through work or privately offered policies, provides additional coverage to your <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-life-insurance-details-types-explained">primary life insurance policy</a>. It could also be expressed as an additional coverage amount, specialized standalone policies, or riders.&nbsp;</p><p>Before deciding whether or not to apply for supplemental life insurance, check your existing policies to see exactly what is covered, how much you&#39;re paying, and how the payouts work.</p><h2 data-toc-label="What is supplemental life insurance?">What is supplemental life insurance?</h2><p>Supplemental life insurance (also known as voluntary life insurance) is coverage you add to a traditional life insurance policy or basic life insurance policy through work. It expands your existing life insurance coverage to cover your family&#39;s individual financial needs in the event of your death.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="How to get supplemental life insurance&nbsp;">How to get supplemental life insurance&nbsp;</h2><h3>Your employer</h3><p>Many employers offer basic life insurance or <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/group-life-insurance">group life insurance</a> as part of their overall benefits package for free or at a low cost. However, its death benefits tend to be minimal at $25,000 or one to two times your salary. That amount is typically insufficient to support your family after you pass away. That&#39;s why employers also offer supplemental life insurance, usually at an additional <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-an-insurance-premium-definition-cost">premium</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Check with your human resources representative to learn more about group or supplement insurance offered by your company. Be sure to inquire about coverage details and exclusions before opting into a policy at work. You may find that it may not fit your needs.&nbsp;</p><h3>&nbsp;A private insurance company</h3><p>Whether or not your employer offers supplemental life insurance, it&#39;s worth looking into private options as well. Private options often provide a broader range of coverage than most employer-sponsored plans, and you can take a private plan with you from job to job. Group life insurance is only good for as long as you work for that company.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, if you&#39;re young and healthy now but change jobs in a decade, the cost to purchase your own supplemental life insurance policy down the road could be far higher. If you already have a life insurance policy through a private carrier, you may be able to add supplemental coverage to your existing policy for an affordable premium.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="Types of supplemental life insurance">Types of supplemental life insurance</h2><p>Supplemental life insurance comes in different forms. The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/types-of-life-insurance">types of insurance</a> offered vary based on the employer and insurance company.</p><h3>Permanent life insurance</h3><p>A permanent policy offers lifelong coverage and a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/cash-value-life-insurance">cash value</a> component, which grows your policy&#39;s value over time. However, these policies can be significantly more expensive than term policies. It&#39;s worth noting that if you&#39;re young, premiums for <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-whole-life-insurance">whole life insurance</a> may be much cheaper than you think. And being young and healthy is a great opportunity to lock in low rates for this comprehensive policy.&nbsp;</p><p>Employers don&#39;t typically offer permanent policies, but you can purchase one with a private insurance company. In fact, if you already have a term policy, insurers usually offer <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/converting-term-life-insurance-to-permanent-life-insurance">term-to-perm conversions</a>. This allows you to convert your term life policy into a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-permanent-life-insurance">permanent life insurance policy</a> without undergoing another medical exam. However, you&#39;ll need to do so within a certain period of time.</p><h3>Term life insurance</h3><p>If you can&#39;t afford a permanent policy, you can more term life insurance in addition to your primary life insurance policy. One strategy is to ladder your life insurance policies. This involves purchasing several term life policies with different coverage amounts at the same time.</p><p>For example, say you need $1 million in coverage right now. However, as your children become adults and your mortgage gets paid off, your coverage needs decrease. So, your policy ladder may look like this:&nbsp;</p><ul><li aria-level="1">10-year term policy with $500k</li><li aria-level="1">20-year term with $300k&nbsp;</li><li aria-level="1">30-year term with $200k</li></ul><p>Laddering your policies has several benefits. It allows you to reduce your premiums over time, lock in your premiums at a younger age, and customize your policy based on current needs and future needs.</p><h3>No medical exam insurance</h3><p>One of the main perks of employer-sponsored life insurance is that it&#39;s available to all employees, and you likely don&#39;t have to take a medical exam for supplemental insurance. In contrast, if you&#39;re buying supplemental life insurance through a private insurer, you may have to go through the underwriting process again.&nbsp;</p><p>If you&#39;re concerned about your health affecting your eligibility, you can opt for <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/no-medical-exam-life-insurance">no medical exam insurance</a>. These policies come in two forms: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/guaranteed-issue-life-insurance">guaranteed issue</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/simplified-issue-life-insurance">simplified issue</a> life insurance.</p><p>Guaranteed issue life insurance (also known as <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/funeral-insurance-a-good-addition-to-your-life-insurance-policy">final expense life insurance</a> or burial life insurance) doesn&#39;t require a medical exam or health questionnaire. Simplified issue life insurance also has no medical exam but requires a health questionnaire (though fewer questions are asked than in a traditional policy).&nbsp;</p><p>Be aware that these policies usually come with higher premiums and limited coverage compared to a traditional policy. You can find our guide on the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-no-medical-exam-life-insurance">best no exam life insurance</a> here.</p><h3>Spousal and child coverage</h3><p>If you have a non-income-earning spouse, a spouse whose employer doesn&#39;t offer life insurance benefits or children, you may be able to obtain affordable dependent life insurance through work.&nbsp;</p><p>If your spouse were to pass away, this policy would replace their income or pay for household duties such as cleaning and childcare that they were originally in charge of. If your child passes away, it offers enough coverage to pay for end-of-life expenses, so you can focus on grieving the loss of a loved one.&nbsp;</p><p>You can also purchase <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-dependent-life-insurance-coverage-non-income-earners">dependent life insurance</a> through a private insurer. But like your life insurance policy, it tends to be more expensive and may require an extensive underwriting process.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Supplemental life insurance riders">Supplemental life insurance riders</h2><p>Supplemental insurance can come in the form of riders, which can be added to your policy for an additional premium or for free. These are just a few common riders:&nbsp;</p><ul><li aria-level="1"><strong>Waiver of premium</strong>: Waives your policy premiums if you develop a critical illness, are severely injured, or are physically impaired and unable to work.&nbsp;</li><li aria-level="1"><strong>Accidental death and dismemberment (AD&amp;D)</strong>: Pays a death benefit if you die or sustain severe injuries or dismemberment (e.g., paralysis, loss of limbs, sight, hearing, etc.) after an accident.</li><li aria-level="1"><strong>Critical illness: </strong>Pays a benefit for medical expenses due to a critical health condition, such as cancer, a heart attack, paralysis, etc.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2 data-toc-label="Cost considerations for supplemental life insurance">Cost considerations for supplemental life insurance</h2><p>Depending on where you work, your employer may offer supplemental life insurance for free or at a low cost, as little as $2 per paycheck. In contrast, private insurance tends to be more expensive.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Policygenius, the average cost of a 20-year, $500,000 term life insurance policy for a male and female with a Preferred <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/can-i-get-life-insurance-if-i-have-pre-existing-conditions">health rating</a> is $26 per month. The average cost of a whole life insurance policy for someone with the same health classification is $451 per month.</p><p>If you&#39;re buying supplemental insurance with a private insurer down the line, you&#39;ll likely have to undergo additional underwriting. Based on your age and health status, your premiums will likely increase, especially if you&#39;re buying extra insurance later. Policy premiums increase about 4% to 9% each year, according to Policygenius.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="How to choose supplemental life insurance">How to choose supplemental life insurance</h2><p>The chief course of action is to consider if you need supplemental life insurance. If you don&#39;t already have a good term or whole life policy, that&#39;s where you&#39;ll start. A good life insurance policy offers much more coverage than a supplemental policy, especially if you have a family or other dependents. The earlier and healthier you are when you get a policy, the lower your monthly premiums are likely to be.</p><p>Just as it&#39;s important to understand what supplemental life insurance is, it&#39;s equally as important to understand what it is not: A supplemental life insurance policy should never take the place of a solid life insurance policy, whether that&#39;s a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-the-difference-between-term-and-whole-life-insurance">term or whole life policy.</a> If you&#39;re in the market for new coverage, consider checking out Insider&#39;s round-up of the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-life-insurance-companies">best life insurance companies</a> available.</p><p>Then you&#39;ll want to evaluate your dependent&#39;s needs and financial goals. How much more do you need to subsidize your family&#39;s day-to-day expenses, pay off the mortgage, or send your children off to college tuition? Would you like to leave an inheritance for your family? What types of coverages can help you achieve those goals?&nbsp;</p><p>You&#39;ll also want to consider where to get supplemental life insurance: through your employer or through a private company. Private life insurance may offer more types of coverage and coverage amounts, as well as the ability to customize your policy with different riders. A non-employer-sponsored policy also follows you, even when you leave your job.&nbsp;</p><p>On the flip side, group supplemental life insurance is usually more affordable and easier to qualify for.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="Supplemental life insurnace FAQs">Supplemental life insurnace FAQs</h2><h3 class="faq-question">Who should consider supplemental life insurance?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Consider supplemental life insurance if your current coverage doesn&#39;t sufficiently cover your needs. Those who have specific concerns, such as terminal illness, accidental injuries, or financial protection in the event of a dependent&#39;s death, may benefit from supplemental coverage.</p><h3 class="faq-question">Can supplemental life insurance be purchased independently?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Yes. You can purchase supplemental policies outside of employer-sponsored plans or as standalone policies to fit your specific coverage needs. Be aware that these policies tend to be more expensive than group supplemental insurance or riders.</p><h3 class="faq-question">How does AD&amp;D coverage differ from standard life insurance?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Accidental death and dismemberment (AD&amp;D) coverage specifically pays out in the event of accidental death, such as a car accident or a fall. It also pays benefits early in the case of dismemberment, such as loss of limbs sight, or speech. Standard life insurance covers a broad range of death causes, including accidental deaths or illnesses. However, it doesn&#39;t offer dismemberment coverage.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="faq-question">What factors should I consider when choosing supplemental life insurance?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Consider your financial situation, potential future needs, and any coverage gaps in your current policy. You&#39;ll also want to choose where to purchase supplemental insurance from: your employer or a private insurance company.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="faq-question">Are there any drawbacks to supplemental life insurance?</h3><p class="faq-answer">While supplemental insurance provides additional coverage, it&#39;s important to ensure it fits your budget and doesn&#39;t overlap with existing policies, causing you to overpay for coverage.</p><div class="read-original">Read the original article on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-supplemental-life-insurance-coverage-explainer">Business Insider</a></div>]]></content:encoded>

<li>The price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) ratio measures a company&#39;s stock price in relation to its earnings per share.</li>
<li>A low P/E ratio can indicate that a stock is undervalued, while a high P/E ratio can indicate that a stock is overvalued.</li>
<li>A company&#39;s P/E ratio provides insight when compared with others in the same industry, or its sector overall.</li>
</ul><p>When picking stocks, everyone always wants to get a good deal &mdash; companies that not only are worthwhile but are trading at a decent price. One time-honored tool for assessing the value of a stock is the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio.</p><p>The P/E ratio is a measure that allows investors to analyze the trading price of a stock and to compare it with others. It can help you determine if a stock&#39;s market price is fair relative to the profits the company produces. As a result, it can be helpful to know the ins and outs of calculating the P/E ratio for stock analysis.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="What is the P/E ratio?"><strong>What is the P/E ratio?</strong></h2><h3>Definition and formula for calculating P/E ratio&nbsp;</h3><p>Expressed as a single number, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio measures a company&#39;s stock price in relation to its earnings per share (EPS).&nbsp;</p><p>The P/E ratio is usually indicated along with its price and other key metrics on most online services that provide stock quotes. Here&#39;s the formula used to calculate it:&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/5fd256ea7b7e05001910733b?format=jpeg" height="1877" width="5001" charset="" alt="price to earnings ratio 01"/><figcaption><p class="copyright">Yuqing Liu/Business Insider</p></figcaption></figure><h2 data-toc-label="How the P/E ratio works&nbsp;"><strong>How the P/E ratio works</strong>&nbsp;</h2><h3>Interpreting the P/E ratio values&nbsp;</h3><p>The P/E ratio tells an investor how much hypothetically they are paying for $1 of a company&#39;s profits. So, for example, if the share price of a company is $50 and its EPS is $5, the P/E ratio would be 10. In effect, an investor would be willing to pay $10 for $1 of a company&#39;s earnings if they purchased the stock.</p><p>Now, if another company in the same industry also has a share price of $50 but an EPS of $20, its P/E ratio would be 2.5, meaning it would cost $2.50 to purchase $1 of that company&#39;s earnings. The second company is the better value, in theory, if all other variables are equal.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Types of P/E ratios&nbsp;"><strong>Types of P/E ratios</strong>&nbsp;</h2><h3>Trailing P/E vs. Forward P/E&nbsp;</h3><p>There are two main ways to look at a company&#39;s P/E ratio. One is based on historical, or trailing, earnings. This is called the trailing P/E ratio. The other uses a company&#39;s projected earnings, based on analysts&#39; estimates, to determine its P/E ratio. This is often referred to as its forward P/E ratio.</p><p>While both measure a company&#39;s share price relative to its profits, it&#39;s important to note that they can sometimes tell different stories. For example, a stock with a relatively high 12-month trailing P/E ratio could lead you to believe that the shares are overvalued. However, if the stock&#39;s 12-month forward P/E ratio is lower, it may mean that analysts have been expecting increasing profitability.</p><p>Considering both types of P/E ratios will give you a fuller picture of a stock&#39;s valuation.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Significance of the P/E ratio</strong></h2><h3>What a high or low P/E ratio indicates about a stock&nbsp;</h3><p>The P/E ratio is a large component of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-to-invest-in-stocks">value investing</a>, a strategy that seeks out companies whose stocks appear to be trading below their fundamental worth.</p><p>In general, a low P/E ratio can indicate that a stock is undervalued or that it is performing well, while a high P/E ratio can indicate that a stock is overvalued or that investors expect its performance to improve in the future.</p><p>The P/E ratio can be used to evaluate a company on its own, in comparison to other companies, or to a benchmark.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, if an investor is deciding between investing in a single stock or an <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-an-etf">exchange-traded fund</a> that tracks the S&amp;P 500, an investor can weigh the P/E ratios of both the company and the S&amp;P 500 itself to see which is a better value.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="Using the P/E ratio in investment decisions"><strong>Using the P/E ratio in investment decisions</strong></h2><h3 data-toc-label="Comparing P/E ratios within industries&nbsp;">Comparing P/E ratios within industries&nbsp;</h3><p>So what&#39;s a high and low P/E ratio? There&#39;s no simple answer. It all depends on the type of company you&#39;re dealing with.&nbsp;</p><p>When using the aforementioned metric to evaluate stocks, it is crucial to perform P/E ratio comparison within sectors.&nbsp;</p><p>That&#39;s because each sector and industry will have its own P/E ratio, which will be the average of the P/E ratios of the companies in that specific sector or industry.</p><p>There can be significant differences in average P/E ratios between sectors. For instance, you might find P/E ratios as high as 30 in health care and as low as 10 in financial services.&nbsp;</p><p>The reason for the disparity is that different industries have unique characteristics. For example, the capital expenditures of an airline company are higher than that of a technology firm and so it will have completely different debt levels and profits, and therefore P/E ratios.</p><p>So, the P/E ratio really only provides insight when it is compared with other companies in the same industry &mdash; or to the average of the sector overall.</p><p>&#34;Every industry is going to have its own best ratios,&#34; says Evan Fisher, CEO at Unicorn Business Plans, which creates corporate models and plans.&nbsp;</p><p>That being said, &#34;for certain industries, the P/E ratio applies much more as a relevant metric than for others,&#34; Fisher adds. &#34;Retail, consumer, manufacturing &mdash; things of that nature. Versus younger, high-growth industries &mdash;for example, tech &mdash; where it may not be so relevant&#34; because the firms have yet to post significant earnings.&nbsp;</p><h3>Limitations and considerations when using P/E ratio</h3><p>Investors can benefit significantly from knowing the limitations of P/E ratio in evaluating stocks. Further, there are other considerations that can prove quite helpful to their analysis.&nbsp;</p><p>For starters, potential investors should not rely on a single metric when evaluating a company&#39;s stock, as no individual metric can tell you whether a company&#39;s shares represent a prudent investment.&nbsp;</p><p>Another major consideration is that P/E multiples can vary quite a bit between sectors, making the metric more useful for comparing companies within a specific industry.&nbsp;</p><p>Past that, the P/E ratio is not particularly helpful in evaluating companies that have not yet turned a profit.&nbsp;</p><p>Further, companies report earnings, whereas the price of a stock is determined by the market. Obviously enough, earnings figures can be fabricated, so interested parties should not rely on P/E data alone.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>The bottom line&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>A P/E ratio gives you insight into the current price of a stock: whether that stock is over or undervalued in relation to its peers and also to its own historical price. Focusing on fundamentals &mdash; a company&#39;s earnings per share &mdash; it blocks out external noise, like a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-a-bull-market">market bubble</a> that&#39;s pushing prices inordinately high, or <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-a-bear-market">panicky sell-offs</a>, which could push them lower.&nbsp;</p><p>The P/E ratio is only one source of information and it should be used to aid an analysis rather than as a sole point of data to rely on.</p><p>&nbsp;&#34;It&#39;s not something we ever look at in isolation,&#34; Fisher says. &#34;I would take the P/E ratio as one of the facets of the diamond that is the company. But you have to look at all the other facets as well, things like management effectiveness, future earnings forecasts, existing assets, positioning versus competitors, customer satisfaction.&#34;</p><h2 data-toc-label="FAQs">FAQs</h2><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>What does a high P/E ratio indicate?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">A high P/E ratio indicates that a company&#39;s share prices are high relative to its earnings per share, which could mean that investors are optimistic about the company&#39;s future prospects. However, this could also indicate a company&#39;s stock is overpriced.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>Can you compare P/E ratios across different sectors?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">While P/E ratios can be helpful when analyzing companies, using them to compare companies in different sectors can prove misleading, as their industry growth rates could vary quite a bit.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>How does the P/E ratio differ from the PEG ratio? </strong><strong><br/></strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/peg-ratio">Price/Earnings to Growth</a> (PEG) ratio accounts for expected earnings growth, providing a more complicated metric than the P/E ratio.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>Is a lower P/E ratio always better?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">While a lower P/E ratio might point out a solid value, it might also signal that a company lacks growth prospects or suffers from other challenges.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>How can investors use the P/E ratio to make investment decisions? </strong><strong><br/></strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">Investors can use the P/E ratio to determine whether a company&#39;s stock is overvalued or undervalued and compare stocks within the same sector or industry. However, they should keep in mind that interested parties should make use of other financial metrics when evaluating an individual stock.</p><div class="read-original">Read the original article on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-pe-ratio">Business Insider</a></div>]]></content:encoded>

The downside is that your death benefit or coverage amount is limited, and your premiums will be higher.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="What is a pre-existing condition?">What is a pre-existing condition?</h2><p>Pre-existing conditions are health problems that exist before you apply for coverage. According to HealthCare.gov, common pre-existing conditions include asthma, diabetes, and cancer.</p><p>Life insurance companies evaluate pre-existing conditions based on risk. For example, asthma diagnoses have a different risk valuation than cancer. If you have cancer, most life insurance providers will have a waiting period &mdash; usually five years &mdash; before you become eligible for traditional life insurance.</p><h2 data-toc-label="How pre-existing conditions affect life insurance">How pre-existing conditions affect life insurance</h2><p>The underwriting process is how the insurance company determines your insurability. This process evaluates how much of a risk you are and how much to lend you. During the underwriting process, the company collects information about your medical, job, income, finances, and other personal information.&nbsp;</p><p>Traditional life insurance policies require a medical exam, which includes a blood test and urine sample, as part of the underwriting process. If a health issue is discovered during the exam process, you may find it more difficult to obtain coverage.</p><p>Based on your medical exam, insurers assign a risk assessment category and calculate your premiums based on this category.

The benefit of no medical exam life insurance is that acceptance is typically guaranteed.&nbsp;</p><p>However, not knowing your medical history means the insurance company is taking a gamble on your health. So, insurers offer limited coverage amounts &mdash; usually up to $100,000 &mdash; and enforce a waiting period before your beneficiaries can file a claim.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There are two types of no medical exam life insurance: guaranteed issue and simplified issue.&nbsp;</p><h4>Guaranteed issue life insurance&nbsp;</h4><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/guaranteed-issue-life-insurance">Guaranteed issue life insurance</a> doesn&#39;t require a medical exam or medical questionnaire. This policy is sometimes referred to as &#34;<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/funeral-insurance-a-good-addition-to-your-life-insurance-policy">final expense</a>&#34; insurance because the coverage amounts are so low that it basically only covers funeral and burial expenses.</p><p>Most guaranteed issue life insurance policies have a two-year waiting period. This means that if the policyholder dies within the first two years of having coverage, the policy won&#39;t pay out. Also, you must be 50 and over to qualify.</p><p>For guaranteed life insurance, your <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-an-insurance-premium-definition-cost">premium</a> depends on your age, gender, where you live, and coverage amount. Be aware that coverage amounts are limited and vary by insurance provider.</p><h4>Simplified issue life insurance</h4><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/simplified-issue-life-insurance">Simplified issue life insurance</a> doesn&#39;t have age restrictions or require a medical exam. However, you&#39;ll need to complete a health questionnaire, though it won&#39;t be as extensive as traditional life insurance. Also, death benefit amounts are higher than with guaranteed issue life insurance.&nbsp;</p><p>Like guaranteed issue, some simplified issue no medical exam life insurance policies have a two-year waiting period, according to Colonial Penn.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Types of policies available">Types of policies available</h2><h3>Traditional term and permanent life insurance</h3><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-term-life-insurance">Term life insurance</a> offers temporary coverage for a designated period of time, usually between 10 to 30 years. This policy is the least expensive <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/types-of-life-insurance">type of insurance</a>, making it accessible to shoppers with good health on a tight budget.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike term life insurance, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-permanent-life-insurance">permanent life insurance</a> offers lifelong coverage. It also comes with a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/cash-value-life-insurance">cash value</a> component, which allows you to save or invest a portion of your premiums to increase your policy&#39;s value. However, because of its benefits, permanent life insurance is more expensive than term life.&nbsp;</p><p>Two common permanent insurance policies are whole life and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/universal-life-insurance">universal life insurance</a>. With a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-whole-life-insurance-companies">whole life insurance policy</a>, you pay a fixed premium for a guaranteed death benefit. The policy&#39;s cash value also grows at a fixed interest rate.&nbsp;</p><p>With a universal life policy, you can adjust your premiums and death benefit amount when you need to. For example, you may want to lower your death benefit when your children become adults and move out. As a result of lowering your death benefit, your premiums decrease.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="Tips for applying with pre-existing conditions">Tips for applying with pre-existing conditions</h2><p>Take a look at the following life insurance application tips for medical conditions.&nbsp;</p><h3>Comparing policies and insurers</h3><p>Comparing insurance policies from various insurers will help you find the best price for the coverage you need. The Insurance Information Institute recommends gathering quotes from at least three companies. If you don&#39;t know where to start, consider asking your friends or family for referrals. You can check out our guide on the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-life-insurance-companies">best life insurance companies</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>While finding a policy that fits your budget is important, the lowest price isn&#39;t all you should be looking for. You should evaluate each company&#39;s reputation by checking their financial stability and customer satisfaction. Additionally, look at online reviews from rating agencies like Trustpilot, the Better Business Bureau, and ConsumerAffairs., to see what real users are saying about the company.&nbsp;</p><h3>Working with insurance brokers</h3><p>Unlike auto or renters insurance, most life insurance companies don&#39;t offer online quoting tools on their websites. So, you&#39;ll likely have to call each company to obtain an estimate.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, this can be time-consuming. To expedite the quote comparison process, consider working with an insurance broker to compare multiple quotes at once.</p><p>Mark Williams, CEO of Brokers International, told Business Insider that people with pre-existing medical conditions should use independent agents while shopping for life insurance. Companies underwrite differently, and agents would know which ones are more flexible when it comes to pre-existing health conditions and other high-risk factors.</p><h3>Disclosing medical history accurately</h3><p>Since insurance companies cross-check your information with medical records, concealing a pre-existing condition will likely result in your application being denied.&nbsp;</p><p>Even if your insurer approves you for coverage, it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s guaranteed. Insurers have what is called a contestability period. If you die within two years of your policy, your insurance company can refuse to pay your beneficiaries a death benefit if they find out you&#39;ve misrepresented information on your application.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="Pre-existing conditions and life insurance FAQs">Life insurance with pre-existing conditions FAQs</h2><h3 class="faq-question">Will having a pre-existing condition always increase my life insurance premiums?</h3><p class="faq-answer">While pre-existing conditions can influence premiums, the extent varies by the severity and frequency of the health issue. For example, insurers will likely view someone with asthma as less risky to insure than someone with a terminal illness. However, risk valuation methods and criteria vary by insurance company.</p><h3 class="faq-question">Can I be denied life insurance coverage because of a pre-existing condition?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Yes, based on the type of pre-existing condition, insurance companies can deny life insurance coverage. Some policies, like guaranteed issue life insurance, don&#39;t require medical underwriting, making it easier to qualify for. However, these policies may come with higher premiums and limited benefits.</p><h3 class="faq-question">What should I disclose about my pre-existing condition when applying for life insurance?</h3><p class="faq-answer">It&#39;s important to disclose your medical history, including diagnosis, treatment, and management to avoid the risk of your application being rejected or your policy being voided.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="faq-question">How can I find the best life insurance policy for a pre-existing condition?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Consider consulting an insurance broker with experience working with high-risk applicants. They point you in the direction of the best policies and insurers for your specific situation.</p><h3 class="faq-question">Are there life insurance policies that don&#39;t require a medical exam?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Guaranteed issue and simplified issue life insurance don&#39;t require a medical exam. However, these policies tend to have higher premiums and graded death benefits.</p><div class="read-original">Read the original article on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/can-i-get-life-insurance-if-i-have-pre-existing-conditions">Business Insider</a></div>]]></content:encoded>

A company with a high quick ratio can meet its current obligations and still have some liquid assets remaining.</p><h2 data-toc-label="What is the quick ratio?"><strong>What is the quick ratio?</strong></h2><h3>Definition and significance&nbsp;</h3><p>The quick ratio measures a company&#39;s ability to pay its short-term liabilities when they come due. It&#39;s also called the acid test ratio, or the quick liquidity ratio, because it uses quick assets, or those that can be converted to cash within 90 days or less. This includes cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and current accounts receivable.</p><h3><strong>Why is knowing the quick ratio important?&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>A quick ratio of 1 is considered the industry average. A quick ratio below 1 shows that a company may not be in a position to meet its current obligations because it has insufficient assets to do so. This tells potential investors that the company in question is not generating enough profits to meet its current liabilities.&nbsp;</p><p>On the contrary, a company with a quick ratio above 1 has enough liquid assets to be converted into cash to meet its current obligations. In essence, it means the company has more quick assets than current liabilities.<br/><br/>&#34;The quick ratio is important as it helps determine a company&#39;s short-term solvency,&#34; says Jaime Feldman, current tax director at Forrest Robinson and former tax manager at Fiske &amp; Company. &#34;It&#39;s the company&#39;s ability to pay debt due soon with assets that quickly convert to cash. You can use the quick ratio to determine a company&#39;s overall financial health.&#34;</p><aside class="quick-tip headline-regular ignore-typography"><p><strong>Note:</strong> A relatively high quick ratio isn&#39;t necessarily good. It could mean that the company is not making good use of its capital to generate more profits.&nbsp;</p></aside><h2 data-toc-label="Calculation"><strong>Calculating the quick ratio</strong></h2><h3>Formula and components&nbsp;</h3><p>The quick ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of a company&#39;s liquid assets by its current liabilities. This is the basic formula:</p><figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/618952d8326b260018353d0f?format=jpeg" height="699" width="1667" charset="" alt="Quick Ratio Formula"/><figcaption><p class="copyright">Alyssa Powell/Insider</p></figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Quick assets</strong></h3><p>Quick assets are those that can be quickly turned into cash. Accounts receivable, cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities are some of the most liquid items in a company.&nbsp;</p><p>For an item to be classified as a quick asset, it should be quickly turned into cash without a significant loss of value. In other words, a company shouldn&#39;t incur a lot of cost and time to liquidate the asset. For this reason, inventory is excluded from quick assets because it takes time to convert into cash.&nbsp;</p><p>Companies usually keep most of their quick assets in the form of cash and short-term investments (marketable securities) to meet their immediate financial obligations that are due in one year.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Current liabilities</strong></h3><p>Current liabilities are a company&#39;s short-term debts due within one year or one operating cycle. Accounts payable is one of the most common current liabilities in a company&#39;s balance sheet. It can also include short-term debt, dividends owed, notes payable, and income taxes outstanding.</p><h2><strong>Example using quick ratio</strong></h2><p>Let&#39;s say you own a company that has $10 million in cash and cash equivalents, $30 million marketable securities, $15 million of accounts receivable, and $22 million of current liabilities. To calculate the quick ratio, divide current liabilities by liquid assets. In this case:</p><p>Quick assets = ($10 million cash + $30 million marketable securities + $15 million accounts receivable)</p><p>Current liabilities = $22 million</p><p>Quick ratio = $55 million / $22 million = $2.5 million.</p><p>The company&#39;s quick ratio is 2.5, meaning it has more than enough capital to cover its short-term debts.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="How to interpret the quick ratio&nbsp;"><strong>How to interpret the quick ratio</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2><h3>What different values indicate&nbsp;</h3><p>Investors who are evaluating <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-liquidity">liquidity</a> analysis using the quick ratio should keep a few things in mind. A higher quick ratio is generally better, as it points to a company that is more resilient and prepared to cover its short-term obligations. However, interested parties should keep in mind that a very high quick ratio may not be a positive development.&nbsp;</p><p>It could mean that a company is highly liquid, or alternatively, it could point to an organization that is not using its resources effectively and could be investing in developments that could bolster its future prospects.&nbsp;</p><p>A value of more than 1 indicates that a company has more quick assets than liabilities, meaning that it can likely cover its obligations over the next year using some of its most liquid assets.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, a quick ratio below 1 means that a company may have a hard time paying its obligations in the short-term.&nbsp;</p><p>Further, it is important to note that quick ratios can vary between industries, so this ratio is more valuable when used to compare companies within the same industry.&nbsp;</p><aside class="quick-tip headline-regular ignore-typography"><p><strong>Note:</strong> While the quick ratio is a crucial metric when evaluating a company&#39;s overall financial health, it may not be foolproof as to whether a business entity is a good investment or not.</p></aside><h2 data-toc-label="Advantages"><strong>Advantages of using the quick ratio</strong>&nbsp;</h2><h3>Immediate insight into financial health&nbsp;</h3><p>One benefit of the quick ratio is that it can provide a quick glimpse of a company&#39;s financial status by comparing some of its most liquid assets to its liabilities. Harnessing this ratio, interested parties can quickly compare companies within the same industry.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="Comparison with other liquidity ratios&nbsp;">Comparison with other liquidity ratios&nbsp;</h2><p>Investors who are looking to perform in-depth assessments of companies can benefit from comparing liquidity metrics in financial analysis. The quick ratio, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/current-ratio">current ratio</a>, and cash ratio can all be used to measure this kind of financial health.&nbsp;</p><h3>Quick ratio vs. current ratio&nbsp;</h3><p>The quick ratio and current ratio are two metrics used to measure a company&#39;s liquidity. While they might seem similar, they&#39;re calculated differently. The quick ratio yields a more conservative number as it only includes assets that can be turned into cash within a short period 一 typically 90 days or less.&nbsp;</p><p>Conversely, the current ratio factors in all of a company&#39;s assets, not just liquid assets in its calculation. That&#39;s why the quick ratio excludes inventory because it takes time to liquidate.</p><h3>Quick ratio vs. cash ratio&nbsp;</h3><p>The cash ratio is another metric used to measure a company&#39;s liquidity. This particular metric is an even more conservative measure than the quick ratio that only takes cash and cash equivalents into account.&nbsp;</p><p>If a company had to cover its obligations right away, the cash ratio can give you a sense of how easily it could do so without using anything besides cash and cash equivalents.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Limitations"><strong>Limitations of the quick ratio </strong><strong><br/></strong></h2><h3>Potential for misinterpretation&nbsp;</h3><p>There are several reasons why the quick ratio could be misinterpreted. For one, this ratio does not account for cash flows, which can have a significant impact on a company&#39;s liquidity.&nbsp;</p><p>Further, it does not take inventory into consideration, and some businesses can liquidate their inventory rather quickly. The impact that inventories have on this ratio may be far more substantial in some industries than in others.&nbsp;</p><p>Past that, using the quick ratio alone is not enough to gauge the liquidity of a company, as interested parties should use other means of analysis, for example different liquidity ratios, to provide a more comprehensive assessment.&nbsp;</p><h3>Contextual factors affecting interpretation</h3><p>Interested parties should take a company&#39;s entire financial situation into account when interpreting its quick ratio. For example, an organization might have significant long-term debt. Should interest rates push higher, such a business might have a hard time meeting its long-term debt obligations. In such a scenario, a company&#39;s quick ratio may not be as helpful in assessing its financial health.&nbsp;</p><p>When evaluating a specific business using the quick ratio, it can prove helpful to get a sense of that organization&#39;s quick ratio history, meaning how this measure has changed over time.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="The quick ratio in different industries&nbsp;"><strong>The quick ratio in different industries</strong>&nbsp;</h2><h3>Variability across sectors&nbsp;</h3><p>Quick ratios can vary significantly between different industries, which is why some recommend using this measure to compare companies within the same industry.&nbsp;</p><p>Potential investors can also benefit from examining industry benchmarks for the quick ratio. Some sectors, for example biotechnology and medical instruments &amp; supplies, have particularly high quick ratios. As of April 2024, the former industry had an average quick ratio of <a href="https://fullratio.com/quick-ratio-by-industry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 4.5</a>, while the latter had a quick ratio of 2.78. Discount stores provided a contrast, as they had an average quick ratio of 0.3.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Conclusion&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>The quick ratio evaluates a company&#39;s capacity to meet its short-term obligations should they become due. This liquidity ratio can be a great measure of a company&#39;s short-term solvency. As an investor, you can use the quick ratio to determine if a company is financially healthy. &#34;The higher the ratio result, the better a company&#39;s liquidity and financial health is,&#34; says Feldman.&nbsp;</p><p>However, it&#39;s essential to consider other liquidity ratios, such as current ratio and cash ratio when analyzing a great company to invest in. This way, you&#39;ll get a clear picture of a company&#39;s liquidity and financial health.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="FAQs">FAQs</h2><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>How is the quick ratio different from the current ratio? </strong><strong><br/></strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">The quick ratio does not include inventory, while the current ratio does, providing a less conservative, but more comprehensive, measure of a company&#39;s liquidity.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>What does a quick ratio of less than 1 indicate?&nbsp;</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">A quick ratio below 1 signals that a company may not have enough liquid assets to cover its liabilities, pointing to potential liquidity problems.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>Can a high quick ratio be seen as a negative sign? </strong><strong><br/></strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">While a high quick ratio is generally viewed positively, a ratio that is too high may point to a company that is not using its resources effectively.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>How often should the quick ratio be calculated? </strong><strong><br/></strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">Interested parties can calculate a company&#39;s quick ratio as needed. They might want to evaluate it on a quarterly or annual basis to coincide with regular financial reporting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>Is the quick ratio applicable to all companies? </strong><strong><br/></strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">The quick ratio can be used to evaluate all companies. However, its relevance may vary based on the industry in question, as some industries make significant use of inventories.&nbsp;</p><div class="read-original">Read the original article on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/quick-ratio">Business Insider</a></div>]]></content:encoded>

<li>Many life insurance providers consider having a felony a high risk and some won&#39;t offer coverage.</li>
<li>If you have a felony, find a life-independent insurance agent that helps high-risk applicants.</li>
<li>If you are denied coverage, consider employer-provided group life insurance or guaranteed issue life insurance.</li>
</ul><p>If you have a criminal record, depending on whether you have a felony or misdemeanor, you may not qualify for life insurance. Insurance providers base life insurance eligibility on your risk and a felony criminal record is seen as a high risk factor. That doesn&#39;t mean there are no life insurance options for those who have a felony. However, you may need to shop around more.</p><h2 data-toc-label="The impact of a felony on life insurance">The impact of a felony on life insurance</h2><p>Both a criminal record and jail time are seen as a risk for life insurance providers. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, &#34;Half of state and federal prisoners and local jail inmates reported having a chronic condition [and] 21% of prisoners and 14% of jail inmates reported having an infectious disease.&#34; It noted that incarcerated individuals were more likely to have health problems than the general American population.&nbsp;</p><p>If you had life insurance before your felony conviction, it is best to continue those payments. If you do not have life insurance and have a recent felony, it will be hard to get coverage due to the recidivism rate for prisoners. The <a href="https://www.bjs.gov/content/reentry/recidivism.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bureau of Justice Statistics</a> stated that, &#34;over two-thirds of released prisoners were rearrested within three years.&#34;</p><h2 data-toc-label="High-risk life insurance coverage options">High-risk life insurance coverage options</h2><p>If you are denied an application for life insurance, fortunately, you have alternatives.</p><h3>Group life insurance&nbsp;</h3><p>The first option is to see if your employer offers <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/group-life-insurance">group life insurance</a>. Group life insurance is a term life policy offered by employers to employees. That means that all employees are accepted. One disadvantage of employer-provided group life insurance is that if you leave your job (resign, retire, or are terminated), you lose your coverage.&nbsp;</p><h3>High-risk insurance providers</h3><p>&#34;For some insurance companies, a felony is uninsurable, but different companies handle felonies differently,&#34; said Jackie Morales, former chief insurance officer at Bestow Life. You could be able to get life insurance if you have a felony, but you will have to find a life insurance agent that deals with high-risk applicants.</p><h3>Guaranteed issue and simplified issue policies</h3><p>Guaranteed issue life insurance is also referred to as <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/funeral-insurance-a-good-addition-to-your-life-insurance-policy">final expense insurance</a> because the coverage amounts are so low that they basically only cover <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/funeral-insurance-a-good-addition-to-your-life-insurance-policy">funeral and burial expenses</a>. There is no exam or health questionnaire, and approval is guaranteed. However, guaranteed issue coverage is typically limited to $25,000, has a waiting period, and is limited to those age 50 and older.</p><p>According to Colonial Penn, there is usually a two-year waiting period for <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/guaranteed-issue-life-insurance">guaranteed issue life insurance</a>, meaning that if the policyholder dies within the first two years of having coverage, the policy won&#39;t pay out.</p><p>Check out those guaranteed issue life mailers that might arrive in your mailbox from Colonial Penn or Mutual of Omaha. Most of these offers are for low coverage amounts, but some coverage is better than none at all.</p><p>Another option is simplified issue life insurance. While this type of insurance doesn&#39;t require a medical exam, it usually requires a health questionnaire. Its terms and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-an-insurance-premium-definition-cost">premiums</a> are also often more favorable than a guaranteed issue insurance policy.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="Factors that influence life insurance eligibility&nbsp;">Factors that influence life insurance eligibility&nbsp;</h2><h3>The type and recency of the felony</h3><p>The type of felony and the length of time between incarceration and probation will be key factors for life insurance companies that insure felons. The passage of time also helps.&nbsp;</p><p>Morales noted that other insurance companies look at the passage of time between your conviction and your application. &#34;If it is a recent felony, Bestow offers other avenues through an affiliated partner who deals with higher risk or specialty medical risks,&#34; she says.</p><p>A misdemeanor may not prevent life insurance coverage. If you are convicted of a felony on behalf of the US government, the definition of a felony is uniform across the nation. However, if you are convicted by the state, the definition of a felony as opposed to a misdemeanor varies from state to state, according to Morales.</p><p>Morales says, &#34;Some states say that one DUI is a misdemeanor and more than one is a felony.&#34; Because the definition of a felony and misdemeanor varies on the state level, it&#39;s important to know the distinction.</p><h3>Completing probation and parole</h3><p>Felons who completed and haven&#39;t been on probation or parole for at least 10 years increase their chances of qualifying for traditional life insurance, according to Progressive.&nbsp;</p><h3>Rehabilitation impact on insurance eligibility</h3><p>According to the U.S. Department of Justice, rehabilitative programming such as correctional education, occupational training, and mental health treatment programs is effective in reducing recidivism. Completing rehabilitation programs illustrates that your risk of reoffense is lower, making you a more suitable candidate for life insurance.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="Completing a life insurance application with a felony conviction">Completing a life insurance application with a felony conviction</h2><h3>Gathering necessary information and documentation&nbsp;</h3><p>Insurance companies request the following information for life insurance applicants:&nbsp;</p><ul><li aria-level="1"><strong>Personal information: </strong>You&#39;ll need to provide your full name, age, marital status, Social Security number, contact information, etc.</li><li aria-level="1"><strong>Medical history:</strong> You&#39;ll be asked to disclose any current or past medical conditions, prescription medication, recreational drug use, or tobacco use.&nbsp;</li><li aria-level="1"><strong>Family medical history: </strong>Chronic conditions in your family such as diabetes, obesity, and cancer, increase your risk of developing those health issues, affecting your life expectancy.&nbsp;</li><li aria-level="1"><strong>Career:</strong> Insurance companies want to know your employment status and salary to determine if you can afford coverage. Additionally, some occupations, like being a sky diving instructor or aircraft pilot, increase your risk as an applicant. So, insurers would like to know that as well.&nbsp;</li><li aria-level="1"><strong>Lifestyle: </strong>High-risk hobbies such as rock climbing, surfing, or contact sports raise mortality risk. Insurers use this information to determine the terms of your policy and your premiums.</li><li aria-level="1"><strong>Beneficiaries:</strong> During your application, you&#39;ll need to provide the full names of the beneficiaries who will receive your death benefit when you pass away.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Disclosing your criminal history</h3><p>During the questionnaire, you&#39;ll be asked about your personal life including your driving health, occupation, hobbies, finances, criminal history, and more. Morales advised giving truthful information on your life insurance application. If you aren&#39;t sure, pause your application until you have all the information.&nbsp;</p><p>Insurance companies will cross-check the information you provided with public records and not answering truthfully can cause your application to be rejected. If your application is approved and you fail to disclose the extent of your criminal history, it can prevent your beneficiaries from receiving your death benefit.&nbsp;</p><h3>Working with an insurance broker</h3><p>If you have a felony record and you&#39;re looking for life insurance, it&#39;s best to find an independent agent who works with multiple insurance companies and is familiar with finding coverage for people with felony records.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="Types of life insurance available">Types of life insurance available</h2><p>Life insurance is a contract between you and the life insurance company where you pay premiums (monthly or annually) for a payout that your living relatives will receive, known as the death benefit. Should you die, the insurance company pays the death benefit to your chosen beneficiary. There are two <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/types-of-life-insurance">types of life insurance</a>: permanent life and term life.&nbsp;</p><h3>Term life insurance</h3><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-term-life-insurance">Term life insurance</a> covers a set time period only, usually 10 to 30 years. If you die during that period, your beneficiaries get your death benefit. Because of its relatively low cost, term life is the type most often recommended to healthy people with dependents.</p><p>You can find our guide on the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-term-life-insurance-companies">best term life insurance</a> here.</p><h3>Permanent life insurance</h3><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-permanent-life-insurance">Permanent life insurance</a> lasts the rest of your life, but it&#39;s significantly more expensive because, in addition to a death benefit, it has a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/cash-value-life-insurance">cash value</a> component that you can borrow against during your lifetime.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Getting life insurance with felony conviction FAQs">Getting life insurance with felony conviction FAQs</h2><h3 class="faq-question">Will a felony conviction prevent me from getting life insurance?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Not necessarily. However, a felony conviction may impact your insurance options and rates, Look into group life insurance with your employer, no medical exam policies, or insurers that specialize in high-risk profiles.</p><h3 class="faq-question">What information about my felony will insurers need?</h3><p class="faq-answer">To assess risk accurately, insurers may ask about the nature of the felony, the conviction date, and any rehabilitation measures taken since then.</p><h3 class="faq-question">Are there life insurance policies that do not require a background check?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Guaranteed issue life insurance policies don&#39;t require a medical exam or detailed background check, though they may have higher premiums and lower coverage limits. Additionally, if your employer offers group life insurance, all employees are eligible to receive coverage.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="faq-question">How can I improve my chances of being approved for life insurance with a felony?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Demonstrating a stable lifestyle (i.e., not engaging in high-risk activities), financial responsibility (i.e., being employed and earning a salary), and rehabilitation can positively influence your chances of approval. Working with a knowledgeable broker can also help navigate your options.</p><h3 class="faq-question">What are the alternatives if I&#39;m denied traditional life insurance?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Some alternatives include group life insurance through your employer, simplified or guaranteed issue life insurance policies, and policies from insurers specializing in high-risk coverage.</p><div class="read-original">Read the original article on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/life-insurance-for-felons">Business Insider</a></div>]]></content:encoded>

It also offers a fully underwritten <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgage-preapproval">preapproval</a> option that can help borrowers make strong offers on homes.

It has a 1-0 <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/seller-buydowns">buydown</a> that lowers your rate by one percentage point for the first year of your mortgage. And its <a href="https://www.embracehomeloans.com/loans/approved2move">Property Value Certificate and Approved to Close Backup Cash Guarantee programs</a>&nbsp;can help you make a stronger offer on a home by guaranteeing financing, enabling you to waive appraisal and financing contingencies if you choose.&nbsp;</p><h3>Non-QM Loans</h3><p>The lender&#39;s Beyond by Embrace mortgages offer a few <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/non-qm-loans">non-QM loan</a> options for borrowers who might not qualify for a traditional mortgage.</p><p>Embrace&#39;s &#34;Beyond&#34; mortgages include:</p><ul><li>Options for borrowers (such as self-employed individuals or real estate investors) who need to use 1099s or bank statements to prove their income instead of the standard W-2s that lenders typically require.</li><li>Mortgages for borrowers with recent bankruptcies, foreclosures, or other negative events on their credit reports.</li></ul><h3>Down Payment Assistance</h3><p>Embrace offers a down payment assistance program for both first-time and repeat homebuyers. With this program you can get a mortgage with no down payment and potentially borrow up to 101% of the home&#39;s value with an interest-only second mortgage that must be paid off when the mortgage is. You&#39;ll need a 660 or better <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-credit-score-is-needed-to-buy-a-house">credit score</a> to qualify.</p><p>This program is only available in the following US states: Alaska, Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona (except Phoenix/Maricopa County), Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois (except Cook County), Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Mississippi, North Carolina, North Dakota, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Interest Rates and Fees">Embrace Home Loans Mortgage Interest Rates and Fees</h2><p>Embrace Home Loans&#39; <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/average-mortgage-interest-rate">mortgage rates</a> are right around average compared to other lenders, according to Business Insider&#39;s review of <a href="https://ffiec.cfpb.gov/data-browser/">Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Embrace doesn&#39;t disclose its current rates or lender fees online. To find out how much you might pay to get a mortgage with this lender, you&#39;ll need to talk to a loan officer or get preapproved for a loan.</p><p>Many lenders provide sample interest rates on their websites to give potential borrowers an idea of the types of rates they offer. Some even offer rate customization tools that let users input some basic information about their credit and the house they&#39;re purchasing to see what they might pay.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2022, the average borrower getting a conventional loan from Embrace paid $3,476 in origination charges, according to HMDA data. This is around average.&nbsp;</p><h2>Embrace Home Loans Overall Lender Rating</h2><h3>Loan Types: 4 of out 5</h3><p>We like that Embrace offers a wide variety of mortgages, including some more niche options like non-QM loans and bridge loans for borrowers with unique needs. But the lender doesn&#39;t have any <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/home-equity-loan-vs-heloc">home equity loans or HELOCs</a>.&nbsp;</p><h3>Affordability: 4 out of 5</h3><p>If you&#39;re looking for an affordable lender, Embrace Home Loans might be a good choice. It has all three of the most popular types of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/government-home-loans">government-backed mortgages</a>, which typically have less stringent credit requirements and lower mortgage rates. It also offers down payment assistance for both first-time and repeat buyers.&nbsp;</p><h3>Customer Satisfaction: 4.97 out of 5</h3><p>On its <a href="https://www.zillow.com/lender-profile/EmbraceHomeLoan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zillow lender profile</a>, Embrace Home Loans has a 4.97 out of 5-star rating, based on over 3,000 online customer reviews.</p><h3>Trustworthiness: 4 out of 5</h3><p>Overall, we found Embrace to be a trustworthy mortgage lender. It currently has an <a href="https://www.bbb.org/us/ri/middletown/profile/mortgage-banker/embrace-home-loans-inc-0021-105270" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A+ rating</a> from the Better Business Bureau. A strong BBB grade indicates a company is honest in its advertising, transparent about business practices, and effective in responding to customer complaints.</p><p>However, Embrace is the defendant in a lawsuit brought by a former employee who alleges she was fired for raising concerns that the lender was originating FHA loans that she said didn&#39;t meet Department of Housing and Urban Development guidelines.&nbsp;</p><h2>Embrace Home Loans Pros and Cons</h2><table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;" border="1"><tbody><tr><td style="width: 50%;"><strong>Pros</strong></td><td style="width: 50%;"><strong>Cons</strong></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 50%;"><ul><li><p>Non-QM mortgages for recent bankruptcies or foreclosures and self-employed borrowers</p></li><li><p>Offers down payment assistance</p></li><li><p>Has renovation loans, bridge loans, and a rate buydown option</p></li></ul></td><td style="width: 50%;"><ul><li aria-level="1">Physical locations are limited to the East Coast</li><li aria-level="1">Doesn&#39;t offer home equity loans or HELOCs</li><li aria-level="1">Lacks rate and fee transparency</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Advantages of Using Embrace Home Loans</h3><p>Embrace is a strong mortgage lender overall, and has a lot of loan options to meet the needs of many different types of borrowers. This includes its non-QM loans for self-employed borrowers, real estate investors, and those who have experienced negative credit events in the recent past.&nbsp;</p><p>If you&#39;re struggling to come up with the cash for a down payment, you might also like Embrace&#39;s down payment assistance program.&nbsp;</p><h3>Considerations and Potential Drawbacks</h3><p>If you want to complete the mortgage process in person, this might not be the right lender for you depending on where you live, since Embrace only has physical branch locations in certain parts of the US. Embrace also doesn&#39;t list sample rates or what fees it charges online, making it hard to gauge how much you might pay with this lender.</p><div class="insider-raw-embed" data-type="embed" data-embed-type="raw" id="22c4b374-271c-4feb-9c46-3323b0b3407b"><div class="myFinance-widget" data-campaign="bi-mtgrt-cashoutrefi-multi" data-widget-id="949ce8ea-ccee-498f-8c33-e019c09fd52f"><script async="" type="text/javascript" id="myFinance-widget-script">!function () {function e() {var s = "myFinance-widget-ad-script";if (!document.getElementById(s)) {var e = document.createElement("script"), n = document.getElementById("myFinance-widget-script"), a = t + "widget/myFinance.js";e.id = s, e.type = "text/javascript", e.async = !0, e.src = a, n.parentNode.insertBefore(e, n);}var c = "myFinance-widget-css";if (!document.getElementById(c)) {var d = document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0], i = document.createElement("link");i.id = c, i.rel = "stylesheet", i.type = "text/css", i.href = t + "widget/myFinance.css", i.media = "all", d.appendChild(i)}}var t = "https://static.myfinance.com/";document.attachEvent ? document.attachEvent("onreadystatechange", function () {"complete" === document.readyState && e()}) : document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", e, !1)}();</script></div></div><h2 data-toc-label="How to Apply">How to Apply</h2><p>You can get started with Embrace Home Loans online, over the phone, or through its convenient mobile app. The app can be used to apply and easily upload any required <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/documents-needed-for-mortgage-application">documentation</a>.</p><p>If you want to get started with a loan officer near you, you can <a href="https://www.embracehomeloans.com/location">search for local branches</a> on its website.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="Customer Service and Experience">Customer Service and Experience</h2><p>Business Insider looked at positive and negative customer reviews, BBB complaints, and other sources to understand what borrowers think about Embrace Home Loans.</p><h3>Easy Experience With Communicative Loan Officers</h3><p>In reviews, many previous borrowers said the process with Embrace Home Loans was smooth and that the professionals they worked with made themselves easy to get ahold of in case borrowers had any questions or concerns.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="Compare Embrace">Compare Embrace to Other Lenders</h2><h3>Embrace Home Loans vs. Rocket Mortgage</h3><p>Embrace Home Loans and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/rocket-mortgage-review">Rocket Mortgage</a>&nbsp;have similar mortgage offerings, though Rocket doesn&#39;t offer USDA loans.</p><p>Rocket Mortgage earned the No. 2 spot in J.D.

      <title>Does Life Insurance Cover Suicide?</title>

<li>Most companies won&#39;t pay death benefits if the insured dies by suicide within two years of buying the policy.</li>
<li>Beneficiaries will receive the death benefit if death happens after the suicide clause timeframe.</li>
<li>The contestability two year period is different than the suicide clause.</li>
</ul><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that suicide rates have increased by 35% since 1999 and that suicide is the 10th most common cause of death in America.</p><p>Some people might think that life insurance policies don&#39;t cover death by suicide. However, most life insurance policies have what&#39;s called a suicide clause. This states that if the policyholder dies due to suicide within the first two years of their policy becoming effective, their policy won&#39;t cover suicide.</p><p>Unfortunately, that doesn&#39;t mean the process is uncomplicated. If the policyholder failed to disclose mental illness on their insurance application, the death benefit might be withheld.</p><h2 data-toc-label="What is life insurance?">What is life insurance?</h2><p>Life insurance is a contract between you and a life insurance company, where you pay <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-an-insurance-premium-definition-cost">premiums</a> (monthly or annually) for a payout that your living relatives will receive upon your death, known as the death benefit. Should you die, the insurance company pays the death benefit to your chosen beneficiary.</p><p>There are two types of life insurance: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-permanent-life-insurance">permanent life</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-term-life-insurance">term life</a>. The difference between term and permanent life insurance is similar to the difference between renting (term life) and owning a home (permanent life). Term life provides coverage for a specific period, while permanent life insurance offers lifelong coverage and includes a cash value component.&nbsp;</p><p>Either can require a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/life-insurance-medical-exam">medical exam</a> as part of the approval process known as underwriting.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Does life insurance cover suicide?&nbsp;">Does life insurance cover suicide?&nbsp;</h2><p>If the policyholder dies by suicide within the first two years of the policy, then the insurance won&#39;t pay a death benefit to your beneficiaries. If the death occurs after the two-year period, beneficiaries receive the death benefit unless other exclusions apply.&nbsp;</p><p>Insurance providers ask if you ever had mental illness or triggered mental health benefits, Mark Williams, CEO of <a href="https://www.biltd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brokers International</a>, told Insider. Williams said that providers also inquire if you&#39;ve used antidepressants, been in therapy, or been hospitalized voluntarily or involuntarily. The answers to these questions will determine the terms and cost of your policy.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Contestability period vs. suicide clause&nbsp;">Contestability period vs. suicide clause&nbsp;</h2><p>In addition to a suicide clause, most insurance companies have a &#34;contestability&#34; period. The contestability period varies by carrier but is usually one to two years from the start of coverage.&nbsp;</p><p>According to AARP, if you die within the first two years of coverage, the insurance company can request your medical history regarding your death. If it is discovered you lied on the application or failed to disclose important facts, the insurance company can invalidate the policy. As a result, your beneficiaries won&#39;t receive your death benefit.</p><p>If you&#39;ve had a mental illness and are considering life insurance, ask your insurance agent about the suicide clause provision. If you already have insurance and are concerned, review your policy and get in touch with your provider.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Suicide clause coverage limits and exceptions&nbsp;">Suicide clause coverage limits and exceptions&nbsp;</h2><h3 data-toc-label="Types of eligible policies&nbsp;">Types of eligible policies&nbsp;</h3><p>People with certain pre-existing mental health conditions may be ineligible for traditional life insurance. However, they may qualify for <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-no-medical-exam-life-insurance">no medical exam life insurance</a> through a simplified issue insurance policy. While this <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/types-of-life-insurance">type of insurance</a> doesn&#39;t require a medical exam, it usually requires a health questionnaire.&nbsp;</p><p>A guaranteed issue policy doesn&#39;t require a medical exam or health questionnaire. However, its premiums are higher than a simplified issue policy and it has coverage limitations. So, guaranteed may be better suited for those with terminal, chronic, or other severe cases.&nbsp;</p><h3>Waiting periods for suicide coverage</h3><p>As mentioned earlier, most insurers enforce the suicide clause. Your beneficiaries won&#39;t receive a death benefit if you die by suicide within the first two years of your policy.&nbsp;</p><h3>Failure to disclose&nbsp;</h3><p>Not all pre-existing conditions will make you ineligible for life insurance. However, failure to disclose certain conditions could result in your beneficiaries not receiving the death benefit.&nbsp;</p><h3>State regulations</h3><p>State variations in life insurance suicide exclusions also exist. For example, some states require insurers to cover physician-assisted suicide (also known as death with dignity or right-to-die) during the two-year exclusionary period. Check your policy documents or speak to your insurance company to determine the extent to which your insurer covers death by suicide.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="Navigating Claims Related to Suicide">Navigating Claims Related to Suicide</h2><p>Filing claims for life insurance after suicide is the same as any other death as long as it occurs after the two-year exclusionary period.&nbsp;</p><p>Beneficiaries must complete a claims form, which they obtain through their insurer&#39;s website or by calling the policyholder&#39;s insurance company. To complete the process, they&#39;ll need the policyholder&#39;s:&nbsp;</p><ul><li aria-level="1">Name</li><li aria-level="1">Date of birth</li><li aria-level="1">Date and cause of death</li><li aria-level="1">State of residence</li><li aria-level="1">Social Security number or policy number</li><li aria-level="1">Death certificate&nbsp;</li></ul><h2 data-toc-label="Mental health resources and support&nbsp;">Mental health resources and support&nbsp;</h2><p>Seeking help for mental health conditions not only improves your quality of life but can qualify you for better terms on your life insurance policy. For example, evidence of mental health management through regular treatment can put you in a lower mortality risk bracket, which lowers your premiums.&nbsp;</p><p>If you or someone you know is struggling with depression or anxiety or having suicidal thoughts, call or text 988 to speak to a representative from the Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="Life insurance and suicide FAQs">Life insurance and suicide coverage FAQs</h2><h3 class="faq-question">Do all life insurance policies exclude suicide?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Most life insurance policies include a suicide clause. This excludes coverage if the death by suicide occurs within a specified period, often two years, after the policy is issued. After this period, your insurer may cover suicides.</p><h3 class="faq-question">What is the contestability period, and how does it relate to suicide coverage?</h3><p class="faq-answer">The contestability period refers to the first two years of the life insurance policy which your insurer can contest or deny claims for misrepresentation on your application. For example, if you fail to disclose a past suicide attempt and you die during the contestability period, this can be grounds for your insurer to deny coverage.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="faq-question">Can a policy be voided if suicide occurs during the waiting period?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Yes, if suicide occurs during the waiting period specified in the suicide clause, the policy may be voided, and premiums paid may be refunded to the estate or beneficiaries.</p><h3 class="faq-question">How do state laws impact suicide coverage in life insurance?</h3><p class="faq-answer">State laws can influence the specifics of your insurer&#39;s suicide provision. For example, some states have death with dignity laws that require insurers to cover physician-assisted suicides, even during the two-year waiting period.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="faq-question">What should beneficiaries know when filing a claim involving suicide?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Beneficiaries should be prepared for the insurance company to conduct a thorough review of the circumstances surrounding the policyholder&#39;s death. They should also know that most policies include a suicide clause, where death by suicide within the first two years of your policy is typically excluded from coverage.&nbsp;</p><div class="read-original">Read the original article on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/does-life-insurance-cover-suicide">Business Insider</a></div>]]></content:encoded>

</ul><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-does-life-insurance-work">Life insurance</a> is a contract between you and the life insurance company, where you pay <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-an-insurance-premium-definition-cost">premiums</a> (monthly or annually) for a payout that your living relatives will receive upon your death, known as the death benefit. Should you die, the insurance company pays the death benefit to your chosen beneficiary.</p><p>There are <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/types-of-life-insurance">two types of life insurance</a>: permanent life and term life. Both can require a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/life-insurance-medical-exam">medical exam</a> as part of the approval process, known as underwriting. Once your insurer approves you for coverage, there are several dates to be mindful of, especially the effective date.</p><h2 data-toc-label="What is the life insurance effective date?">What is the life insurance effective date?</h2><p>The effective date is the date your life insurance coverage begins. If your effective date is September 1, 2021, and you die before then, your policy will not pay your beneficiaries. If you die after this date, your policy will pay your beneficiaries. Your effective date is often tied to the date of your first premium payment.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Underwriting process&nbsp;">Underwriting process&nbsp;</h2><p>The underwriting process is how the insurance company determines your insurability &mdash; deciding how much of a risk you are and how much of a death benefit you qualify for. Several factors that impact your effective date include the underwriting process, your issue date, premium payments, the type of policy, and your age.&nbsp;</p><p>The insurance company collects information about your health, job, income, finances, and other personal information to determine how much it will insure you and what your premium will be. The underwriting process can take four to six weeks, and once you&#39;re approved, you&#39;ll receive a policy.</p><h3>Issue date&nbsp;</h3><p>While the effective date is the day your coverage begins, the issue date is the date your policy is issued to you for your acceptance. If you die between the issue date and the effective date, your beneficiaries will not receive your death benefit unless you opted for temporary coverage.</p><h3>Premium payment&nbsp;</h3><p>After your policy is issued to you for acceptance, most insurance companies require you to sign the papers and pay your first premium before coverage starts. Your effective date may be set for the day payment is received or at a later date.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Type of policy&nbsp;</h3><p>If you have a guaranteed issue or <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/simplified-issue-life-insurance">simplified issue life insurance</a> policy, there is usually a two-year waiting period. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/guaranteed-issue-life-insurance">Guaranteed issue life insurance</a> is sometimes referred to as &#34;<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/funeral-insurance-a-good-addition-to-your-life-insurance-policy">final expense</a>&#34; insurance because the coverage amounts are so low that they basically only cover funeral and burial expenses.</p><p>Guaranteed and simplified life insurance policies are <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-no-medical-exam-life-insurance">no medical exam life insurance</a> policies. Because there is no medical exam, you are a higher risk for the insurance company. Some insurance companies have a two-year waiting period for these policies.&nbsp;</p><p>If you die within the first two years of having coverage, the policy won&#39;t pay out. So if your effective date is September 1, 2021, your beneficiaries will not receive a death benefit unless you die after September 1, 2023. Check with your insurance provider to see if you have a two-year waiting period.</p><h3>Age&nbsp;</h3><p>Age significantly influences how much you&#39;ll pay in premiums. Excluding other factors, the younger you are, the cheaper your policy will be.</p><p>If your birthday or half-birthday passes during the underwriting process, you may request to &#34;backdate&#34; your insurance policy. This means the start of life insurance coverage is before your effective dates, allowing you to lock in lower rates at the age you applied. However, you&#39;ll have to pay additional premiums to account for the gap between your current age and &#34;backdated&#34; age.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="Importance of the effective date">Importance of the effective date</h2><h3>Impact of effective date on insurance claims</h3><p>If you pass away before your policy&#39;s effective date and your beneficiaries file a claim, they won&#39;t receive your death benefit. However, if you have a temporary or another effective policy, your beneficiaries can file a claim and receive coverage.&nbsp;</p><h3>Impact on premiums and billing cycles&nbsp;</h3><p>Your insurer will likely require you to pay your premiums by your effective date. If you&#39;re on a monthly billing schedule, and your effective date is April 15th, your next billing date will be May 15th.&nbsp;</p><p>The same rule applies to yearly renewals, except your effective date will be in the same month and day the following year instead of the following month. Keep in mind that this is contingent on your insurer setting your effective date as your payment date. However, this date may vary by policy and insurer.&nbsp;</p><p>Some companies may require you to pay your bill before the effective date. This can be especially true if the policy was backdated or there is a specific underwriting reason requiring earlier payment.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="Changing the effective date">Changing the effective date</h2><p>Adjusting life insurance effective dates can be difficult once locked in. As mentioned earlier, backdating your policy for premium savings is one way to alter your policy&#39;s effective date. You may also request a change in effective date to align with other policies, but your insurer may not grant this request.</p><p>Otherwise, you&#39;ll likely have to cancel your policy and apply again. This may require you to go through the underwriting process again.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="Precautions and considerations&nbsp;">Precautions and considerations&nbsp;</h2><h3>Ensuring coverage during the application process</h3><p>If you have no previous life insurance policy in effect, some insurance companies provide conditional or temporary life insurance until the underwriting process is complete.</p><p>If you&#39;re undergoing underwriting for a traditional life insurance policy and your provider offers temporary coverage in the interim, you might want to consider it so you know you&#39;re covered while you wait. You pay the regular premium and if you die during underwriting, your beneficiaries receive your death benefit. It ends once you&#39;re approved for full coverage.</p><h3>Contestability period for life insurance</h3><p>Most insurance companies have a &#34;contestability&#34; period. The contestability period varies by carrier but is usually one to two years from the effective date. According to AARP, if you die within the first two years of coverage, the insurance company can request your medical history regarding your death.&nbsp;</p><p>The contestability period is different from the two-year waiting period for guaranteed issue and simplified issue life insurance policies. If it&#39;s discovered that the policyholder lied on the application or failed to disclose important facts, the insurance company can invalidate the policy.</p><h3>Policy expiration date</h3><p>If you have permanent life insurance, your insurance lasts your lifetime. However, if you have <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-term-life-insurance">term life insurance</a>, it lasts for a specific time period &mdash; 5, 10, 15, 20, or 30 years &mdash; and afterward, it must be renewed, which is why it&#39;s less expensive than permanent life insurance.</p><p>Policygenius recommends applying for a new policy six months before your current policy expiration date to avoid a gap in coverage This gives you enough time to undergo the underwriting process and wait for approval.&nbsp;</p><p>Take a look at the expiration dates for a term and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-permanent-life-insurance">permanent life insurance</a>, as well as other important features for both policies.&nbsp;</p><table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;" border="1"><tbody><tr><td style="width: 36.051%;"><p><strong>Term life insurance</strong></p></td><td style="width: 63.8217%;"><p><strong>Permanent life insurance</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 36.051%;"><ul><li aria-level="1">Ends after a specified time frame</li><li aria-level="1">Includes death benefit&nbsp;</li><li aria-level="1">More affordable</li></ul><br/><br/></td><td style="width: 63.8217%;"><ul><li aria-level="1">Lasts your lifetime - never expires</li><li aria-level="1">Includes a death benefit</li><li aria-level="1">Cash value that can be used during your lifetime&nbsp;</li><li aria-level="1">More expensive than term life in the early years of the policy</li></ul><br/><br/></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 data-toc-label="Finding and clarifying your policy&#39;s effective date&nbsp;">Finding and clarifying your policy&#39;s effective date&nbsp;</h2><p>You can find your policy&#39;s effective date on your policy statement via a hard copy your insurer sent through the mail or through your insurer&#39;s online portal. However, if you have any questions or run into any trouble finding your policy&#39;s effective date, reach out to your insurance company. They should be able to help you locate the day your policy goes into effect as well as any other important dates.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="Life insurance effective date FAQs">Life insurance effective date FAQs</h2><h3 class="faq-question">Can the effective date of a life insurance policy be before the policy is issued?</h3><p class="faq-answer">In some cases, yes. Insurers may backdate policies to secure a lower premium rate based on your younger age, but this depends on the insurer&#39;s policies and regulations.</p><h3 class="faq-question">What happens if a life event occurs just before the effective date?</h3><p class="faq-answer">It depends on the life event. If you die before your policy&#39;s effective date, your beneficiaries won&#39;t receive a death benefit. If your health changes, you must disclose these changes to your insurer, which may lead to underwriting reassessments.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="faq-question">Is it possible to change the effective date after the policy is issued?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Changes to the effective date are rare and usually require canceling your policy, performing another health questionnaire and medical exam, and obtaining a policy under new terms (which may not always be favorable).&nbsp;</p><h3 class="faq-question">Does the payment of the first premium coincide with the effective date?</h3><p class="faq-answer">The payment of the first premium often initiates the coverage, aligning closely with the effective date, but specific arrangements vary by insurer and policy.</p><h3 class="faq-question">How do I find out the effective date of my life insurance policy?</h3><p class="faq-answer">The effective date should be clearly stated in your policy documents. If in doubt, contact your insurance provider for clarification.</p><div class="read-original">Read the original article on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/effective-date-life-insurance">Business Insider</a></div>]]></content:encoded>

To do so, it produces a figure called your Expected Family Contribution (EFC).</p><p>Your EFC is a number that establishes whether you qualify for specific types of federal student aid. The information you fill out on your FAFSA &mdash; including your parents&#39; income, their assets, and information about any other family members attending college that year &mdash; determines your EFC.</p><p>Importantly, <strong>your EFC is</strong>&nbsp;<strong>not the amount of money you&#39;ll have to pay for college.&nbsp;</strong>It&#39;s simply a number used by colleges to determine the amount of aid you&#39;re eligible to get.&nbsp;</p><p>Read more about the complete formula used to <a href="https://fsapartners.ed.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/2020-08/2122EFCFormulaGuide.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">calculate your EFC</a>.</p><h2 data-toc-label="How does your EFC impact the aid you receive?">How does your EFC impact the aid you receive?</h2><p>Your Cost of Attendance (COA) is the total cost of college during a given school year. This number includes tuition and fees, room and board, books, supplies, and other miscellaneous expenses.&nbsp;</p><p>Your college will subtract your EFC from your COA to determine your financial need. For example, if your COA is $20,000 and your EFC is $8,000, your financial need is $12,000. This means you are eligible for a maximum of $12,000 in need-based aid.</p><p>However, colleges don&#39;t have to meet 100% of your financial need. Some programs have limited funds, so it&#39;s in your best interest to file the FAFSA as soon as you can for the best chance at qualifying for the most aid.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are types of aid that are based on your EFC:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-pell-grant" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Pell Grants</strong></a>: Given to undergraduate students who display exceptional financial need and haven&#39;t already earned a degree.

Not every school participates.&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-a-subsidized-loan" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Direct Subsidized Loans</strong></a>: A federal student loan available to undergraduate students who have financial need. The Department of Education will cover your interest charges while you&#39;re in school and during a six-month grace period after you graduate. The maximum amount depends on what year of school you are in.&nbsp;</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-federal-work-study" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Work-study</a></strong>: Provides part-time jobs for students with financial need to earn money for academic expenses. The jobs are often on campus, but some are off campus. The government will base your work-study award on when you apply, your level of financial need, and the amount of money your school has available.</li></ul><p>Your eligibility for non-need-based aid is determined by the COA minus all financial aid you&#39;ve received so far, including any additional aid the school offers you or private scholarships.&nbsp;</p><p>Some forms of aid that don&#39;t take your EFC into account include:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Direct Unsubsidized loans</strong>: A federal student loan available to all students who are enrolled at least half-time in an eligible school. Students do not need to demonstrate financial need to qualify for an unsubsidized loan. Interest will begin to accrue as soon as the loan funds are distributed. The maximum amount depends on what year of school you are in.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Direct PLUS Loans</strong>: Graduate students, professional students, and parents of undergraduate students can take out these federal student loans, which come with higher interest rates that Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans. The maximum loan amount you can receive is determined by the COA minus any other financial aid you or your child receive.&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/grants/teach" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TEACH Grants</strong></a>: Require you to be a full-time teacher for four years at a school or&nbsp;educational service agency that serves low-income students.

</ul><h2>Introduction</h2><h3>The significance of credit scores in financial well-being</h3><p>Your <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-a-credit-score">credit score</a> is one of the most important numbers for your personal finances. Your credit score can determine whether you can borrow money and at what cost. An&nbsp;<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-an-excellent-credit-score" rel="noopener nofollow sponsored">excellent credit score</a>&nbsp;can save you thousands of dollars in interest payments.</p><p>When you track your credit score through whatever <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-credit-monitoring-services" rel="nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored">credit monitoring service</a> you use, you may notice seemingly arbitrary fluctuations in your credit score from month to month. However, your credit score is a reflection of information on your credit reports.</p><p>Understanding how credit-scoring algorithms like <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-fico-score">FICO</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-vantagescore" rel="nofollow sponsored">VantageScore</a> calculate your score your credit score will clarify the relationship between your money habits and your credit score. More importantly, you can use this understanding to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-to-improve-credit-score" rel="nofollow sponsored">improve your credit score</a>.&nbsp;</p><div class="insider-raw-embed" data-type="embed" data-embed-type="raw" id="e745757f-980c-42ac-9312-a765c11d5dad"><iframe src="https://products.gobankingrates.com/pub/4a1ed106-7289-11ed-9a44-0a919b37cd73" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="139px" style="max-width:595px;max-height:150px;"></iframe></div><h2 data-toc-label="How is your credit score calculated?">How is your credit score calculated?</h2><p>Unfortunately, FICO and VantageScore keep their exact credit scoring algorithms under wraps. However, we have a general idea of what factors impact your credit score and how heavily they&#39;re weighed. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/vantagescore-versus-fico-score" rel="nofollow sponsored">VantageScore and FICO calculate their credit scores</a> similarly, with a few variations. The full breakdown is as follows:&nbsp;</p><table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; height: 262px;" border="1"><tbody><tr style="height: 22px;"><td style="width: 50%; height: 22px;">FICO</td><td style="width: 50%; height: 22px;">VantageScore</td></tr><tr style="height: 240px;"><td style="width: 50%; height: 240px;"><p>Payment history (35%)</p><p>Credit balance (30%)</p><p>Length of credit history (15%)</p><p>New credit (10%)</p><p>Mix of credit accounts (10%)</p></td><td style="width: 50%; height: 240px;"><p>Payment history (40%)</p><p>Length &amp; type of credit (21%)</p><p>Percent of credit used (20%)</p><p>Total debt/balances (11%)</p><p>Recent credit behavior and inquiries (5%)</p><p>Available credit (3%)</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>This is a lot of information to digest all at once, so let&#39;s dig into each factor.</p><h3>Factors influencing credit scores</h3><h3>Payment history</h3><p>The most important factor in your credit score is your payment history, making up 35% of your FICO score and 40% of your VantageScore. Payment history looks at how consistently you&#39;ve paid bills in the past, counting on-time payments as positive information and late payments, usually at least over 30 days late, as negative information. Your payment history reaches back as far as 10 years.</p><p>Paying off your bills every month is the single best thing you can do for your credit. A survey of Americans with excellent scores found that 100% of them had a perfect payment history with no delinquencies.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/delinquency-on-credit-report" rel="nofollow sponsored">delinquency on your credit report</a> can set your credit score back a few points. The higher your credit score pre-delinquency, the greater the impact a delinquency will have on your credit. While the amount of money in delinquency won&#39;t change anything, the amount of time it remains in delinquency does. Your payment first falls into delinquency after it&#39;s 30 days late, and its impact deepens with each subsequent 30-day period.</p><p>However, a delinquency won&#39;t permanently dent your credit report. It will drop off after seven years, with its effects fading as it gets closer to falling off.</p><h3>Credit utilization&nbsp;</h3><p>Your credit balances and utilization are the next most significant factor in your credit score, making up 30% of your FICO score and 20% of your VantageScore. This category looks at the ratio between the credit you currently use on your revolving credit accounts, like credit cards, and your total available credit. This is called a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-utilization-ratio" rel="nofollow sponsored">credit utilization ratio</a>&nbsp;or a debt-to-credit ratio.&nbsp;</p><p>Credit utilization is applied to all your credit accounts overall, as well as each account individually. The general guidance is to keep your utilization ratio under 30% for a good credit score. However, every dollar you sink into your credit will affect your credit score, so try to keep your credit usage as low as possible.&nbsp;</p><h3>Length of credit history</h3><p>Credit account age is a surprisingly complex calculation that&#39;s tracked in several ways.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The credit-scoring algorithms look at the actual age of your credit accounts in terms of the average age of your credit accounts, the age of your oldest account, and the age of your newest account.&nbsp;</li><li>How long specific accounts have been open</li><li>How long since you&#39;ve last used your accounts</li></ul><p>As you accumulate <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-credit-cards" rel="nofollow sponsored">credit cards</a>, you may find yourself gravitating toward one or two while the rest stay in your junk drawer. That activity, or lack thereof, will show up on your credit report. Credit coach Jeanne Kelly says, &#34;while this isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing, if you&#39;re trying to maximize your credit score, it&#39;s a good idea to rotate your credit cards and consider using accounts that you haven&#39;t used in a few years.&#34;</p><p>Many new accounts lower your average account age, while accounts you&#39;ve had the longest help your average account age. Only open new credit accounts if needed, and only close old accounts if you have to pay an annual fee.</p><aside class="quick-tip headline-regular ignore-typography"><p><strong>Quick tip:</strong> If you want to stop paying for a card with an annual fee, you may be able to downgrade to a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-no-fee-credit-card" rel="nofollow sponsored">no-annual-fee credit card</a> instead of canceling it. This will preserve the age of your original card&#39;s account, avoiding any damage to your credit score.</p></aside><h3>Types of credit in use</h3><p>Two types of credit get reported to your credit report:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-revolving-credit" rel="noopener nofollow sponsored">revolving credit</a>&nbsp;and installment credit. Revolving credit, like credit cards, returns to you once they&#39;re paid off, while installment credit comes in one lump sum that you pay off. The credit scoring algorithm rewards consumers who can balance both types of debt on their credit reports. That means you&#39;re best off if you have credit cards and installment loans, like a mortgage or auto loan. More unique types of loans are best for your credit.</p><p>However, that doesn&#39;t mean you should get a new loan just to help your credit in most cases. Instead, just apply for the credit you need and watch as your score slowly rises over time when you manage your loans well. Your credit mix makes up 10% of your credit score. That said, if you have a few credit cards and no <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-an-installment-loan" rel="nofollow sponsored">installment loans</a>, looking into a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-credit-builder-loans" rel="nofollow sponsored">credit builder loan</a> might be worth your time.</p><h3>New credit and recent credit inquiries</h3><p>The last main category is the pursuit of new credit. Generally, new credit is bad for your credit score, but only temporarily.</p><p>New credit applications lead to hard inquiries on your credit report, slightly hurting your credit score. This negative impact goes down over time and eventually becomes a positive factor. But in the short term, new credit is bad for your credit.</p><h2 data-toc-label="What doesn&#39;t affect your credit score?">What doesn&#39;t affect your credit score?</h2><p>As we said earlier, your credit score reflects your credit reports. That means that anything excluded from your credit reports has no bearing on your credit score calculations.</p><h3>Bank accounts</h3><p>Contrary to popular belief, bank overdrafts don&#39;t hurt your credit. In fact, nothing from your checking or savings accounts directly shows up on your credit report or in your credit score. Banks use a different system, known as <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-chexsystems" rel="nofollow sponsored">ChexSystems</a>, to track overdrafts and other banking information.&nbsp;</p><h3>Tax liens and civil judgments</h3><p>Your credit reports contain a public records section which is used to document tax liens, civil judgments, and bankruptcies. All three of these could affect your credit score. While bankruptcies are still recorded on your credit reports, the credit bureaus decided in 2018 to remove tax liens and civil judgments from credit reports and credit-scoring calculations.</p><p>This doesn&#39;t mean that a tax lien or civil judgment can&#39;t hurt your chances of getting approved for credit, though. These remain open for public viewing, so a lender could still find those documents when reviewing a credit application.</p><h3>Utility and phone bills</h3><p>Your power, water, gas, and phone bills don&#39;t generally appear on your credit report. These companies may check your credit when you open a new account, but they typically don&#39;t send your payment information to the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-bureau-experian-equifax-transunion" rel="nofollow sponsored">credit bureaus</a> for credit reporting.</p><p>That&#39;s slowly changing as optional credit-boosting services like <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/experian-boost-review" rel="nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored">Experian Boost</a> start reporting bill payments to the credit bureaus. Experian Boost has also added regular streaming service payments to its list of reported payments.&nbsp;</p><h3>Rent payments</h3><p>Like your utility and phone bills, your rent payments don&#39;t appear on your credit reports by default. However, you can pay a rent reporting service to report your rent to the credit bureaus, which can help you build credit. Unfortunately, many of these services require the cooperation of your landlord in some capacity.</p><h3>Your income and assets</h3><p>It doesn&#39;t matter to the credit bureaus if you make $1 per year or $1 million per year. Your credit report is all about paying your credit-related bills on time and managing the balances well. Even if you have a ton of money in the bank, you can have a bad credit score if you miss payment due dates. That said, it is easier to keep your credit payments in check with a higher income, and credit scores have been shown to correlate with income level.</p><h3>Checking credit scores or reports</h3><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-to-check-your-credit-score" rel="nofollow sponsored">Checking your credit score</a> and reports does not hurt your credit score. While credit score checks don&#39;t show up on your credit reports, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-to-get-free-credit-report" rel="nofollow sponsored">requesting your credit report</a>&nbsp;from <a href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored">AnnualCreditReport.com</a> will trigger a soft inquiry on your credit reports. Unlike <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-hard-inquiry-how-affect-credit-score">hard inquiries</a>, soft inquiries <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/does-checking-credit-hurt-credit-score" rel="nofollow sponsored">do not impact your credit score</a> and are only visible to you. Soft inquiries are also triggered when creditors check your credit to see if you qualify for pre-approved offers, landlords review your rental application, and insurance companies underwrite your policy.</p><h3>Rate-shopping</h3><p>If you&#39;re buying a new car or home, it&#39;s not a bad idea to shop around for the best interest rates. While each application will generate a new inquiry, the credit bureaus typically bundle inquires from a short period of time, between 30-45 days, and treat them as a single inquiry for credit-scoring purposes.</p><h2 data-toc-label="How different actions affect your score">How different actions affect your score</h2><h3>On-time payments vs. late payments</h3><p>Being that your payment history makes up the largest part of your credit score calculation (35%), on-time payments have the greatest positive impact on your credit score and conversely, late payments will have the greatest negative impact to your credit score. Just one 30-day late payment can drop your credit score by as much as 100 points and will remain on your credit report for seven years.&nbsp;</p><h3>Managing credit card balances</h3><p>Credit utilization, or the amount of credit you have in use, is 30% of your credit score calculation &mdash; so how you manage your credit card balances is important. If you can keep your balances at less than 30% of your credit limit, that will have a postive affect on your credit score. For example, if you have a $1,500 credit limit then keeping your balance under $500 when it reports to the credit bureau will be beneficial.&nbsp;</p><h3>The impact of opening and closing accounts</h3><p>Opening and closing accounts can have an impact on your credit score. Length of credit history is a part of how your credit score is calculated. When you open a new account or close an account it changes the length of your credit history which can have a negative impact on your credit score. Also, a new credit account often comes with a new hard inquiry which can have a negative affect on your credit score.&nbsp;</p><h2>Credit-scoring models</h2><p>FICO and VantageScore have multiple iterations that vary how heavily certain factors are weighed. The most widely used models are FICO 8 or 9 and VantageScore 3.0.</p><p>FICO 10T and VantageScore 4.0 were released in the past few years, FICO 10T in 2020 and VantageScore 4.0 in 2017. However, both models have yet to see wide usage. They use trended data, which considers your account balances within the past 24 months to predict how they will look.</p><p>Previously serving as a snapshot of your credit reports, credit scores under FICO 10T and VantageScore 4.0 gain a sense of your momentum as a consumer. If your credit usage has consistently risen over the last few months, your next balance will likely continue that trend.</p><h2 data-pm-slice="1 1 [&#34;table&#34;,{},&#34;table_row&#34;,{},&#34;table_cell&#34;,{&#34;colspan&#34;:1,&#34;rowspan&#34;:1,&#34;colwidth&#34;:[120]}]">How to improve your credit score</h2><p>The most important step in building good credit or repairing your credit is to get in the habit of making all of your bill payments on time. If you can, set up automatic payments so you never miss a payment. Next, work on credit utilization, and pay all of your balances to below 30% of the credit limit. If you are in debt or have accounts in collections, work with your creditors/lenders to set up a payment plan so that you can pay those accounts off and have a zero balance on your credit report.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="FAQs">Credit score calculations frequently asked questions (FAQ)</h2><h3 class="faq-question" data-pm-slice="1 1 [&#34;list&#34;,{},&#34;list_item&#34;,{&#34;indent&#34;:1,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;numbered&#34;}]"><strong>What is the most important factor in calculating a credit score?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">Your payment history is the most important factor when it comes to calculating your credit score. Your credit report is basically a report card on how you pay your bills and repay your lenders, so making on-time payments is the most important thing you can do.</p><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>How does credit utilization affect my credit score?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">High credit utilization can be a signal that you are in financial trouble or that you are relying too heavily on credit especially if you are applying for more credit, and it may lower your score. It&#39;s best to keep utilization under 30%.</p><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>Can checking my credit score too often hurt it?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">No. You could check your credit score every day if you wanted to. When you check your own credit score it is considered a soft inquiry and does not impact your score. Only hard inquiries from lenders requesting your credit report impacts it.</p><h3 class="faq-question">How accurate is FICO?</h3><p class="faq-answer">The goal of any credit-scoring model is to give lenders a cursory glance into a consumer&#39;s risk level as a borrower. As the leading credit-scoring models in the industry, FICO 8 and 9 are very good at predicting how a borrower will repay their debts. With the eventual wide rollout of FICO 10T, the margin for error gets even slimmer.</p><h3 class="faq-question">How accurate is VantageScore?</h3><p class="faq-answer">VantageScore is accurate in that it is very good at telling lenders how risky a potential borrower is as a customer. According to VantageScore&#39;s most recent available data, 0.1% of consumers with a VantageScore credit score above 801 entered serious delinquency, meaning they were over 90 days late on a payment. Meanwhile, 30% of borrowers with a credit score of 300-500 entered serious delinquency.</p><h3 class="faq-question">Is a 700 credit score good?</h3><p class="faq-answer">A 700 credit score is categorized as a good credit score under VantageScore and FICO.&nbsp;</p><div class="read-original">Read the original article on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-is-credit-score-calculated">Business Insider</a></div>]]></content:encoded>

<li>If you cancel or outlive your term life insurance policy, you don&#39;t get money back.</li>
<li>However, if you have a &#34;return of premium&#34; rider and you outlive the policy, premiums will be refunded.</li>
<li>If you have a convertible term life policy, you can sell it instead of canceling it.</li>
</ul><p>According to Lucas Siegel, CEO of Harbor Life Settlements, 85% of life insurance policies lapse &mdash; meaning the insured individuals outlive the policy or stop paying. If you cancel your term life insurance or you outlive your policy, you won&#39;t get your money back unless you add a &#34;return of premium&#34; rider. However, if you surrender a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-whole-life-insurance">whole life insurance policy</a>, you&#39;ll likely pay fees and taxes.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="How to cancel your life insurance policy&nbsp;">How to cancel your life insurance policy&nbsp;</h2><h3>Canceling a term life insurance policy&nbsp;</h3><p>There are several ways to cancel a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-term-life-insurance">term life insurance policy</a>. You can:&nbsp;</p><ul><li aria-level="1">Stop paying your premiums and let your coverage end</li><li aria-level="1">Wait until the term ends and allow the policy to expire&nbsp;</li><li aria-level="1">Let your insurance company know of your intent to cancel via phone call or mail&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Be aware that canceling your term policy means you won&#39;t get any refund and lose your death benefit. However, if you opted for a return of premium rider when you bought your policy, your insurer will return a portion or all of the money you&#39;ve paid if you haven&#39;t used the policy once your term ends.</p><h3>Surrendering a permanent insurance policy&nbsp;</h3><p>Surrendering or cashing out your policy before you die is a way to end your <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-permanent-life-insurance">permanent life insurance policy</a>. However, liquidating your policy&#39;s <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/cash-value-life-insurance">cash value</a> means you lose life insurance protection and may be subject to surrender charges and taxes.&nbsp;</p><p>Your cash surrender value, or the amount you receive if you surrender your policy, is equal to the amount of cash value built minus any surrender charges. This penalty fee typically decreases over time.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to surrender charges, you may owe income taxes on the proceeds if the surrendered cash value exceeds the premiums you&#39;ve paid into the policy.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="Reasons for canceling">Reasons for canceling</h2><h3>Financial changes or constraints</h3><p>If you can&#39;t afford your premiums, canceling life insurance may be your only option. Before giving up your policy, consider cutting down on non-essential spending like eating out or streaming subscriptions.&nbsp;</p><p>It may also be helpful to evaluate your insurance portfolio. You may be overpaying for insurance in one area, such as your home or auto policy, causing financial strain in the life insurance department. Consider taking a look at Business Insider&#39;s guide to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-to-shop-for-car-insurance-quotes">comparing car insurance</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/home-insurance-quotes">comparing homeowners insurance quotes</a> to help you find the best deals on your policy.&nbsp;</p><h3>Policy no longer meets needs</h3><p>As your children become adults and move out or you pay your mortgage off, your life insurance needs decrease. You may not even need life insurance at all. Prior to canceling your policy, consider anyone who may still depend on you for financial support, such as a non-income-earning spouse or a lifelong adult dependent.&nbsp;</p><h3>Finding a better-suited policy</h3><p>If you can afford higher premiums, you may decide to switch from a term policy to a permanent policy. This type of policy has a cash value component, which allows you to increase its value over time. You can use your earnings to increase your retirement fund, save for long-term care costs, or build an inheritance for your children.&nbsp;</p><p>However, life insurance policies tend to yield subpar returns compared to other investments. So, if you have no financial obligations, carrying a policy may not be worth the cost.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="Considerations before canceling insurance&nbsp;">Considerations before canceling insurance&nbsp;</h2><h3>Financial impact of insurance cancellation on dependents&nbsp;</h3><p>Whether you cancel your term policy or surrender your permanent policy, ending your coverage means your beneficiaries won&#39;t receive death benefits when you die. This could mean your dependents will be without financial support for day-to-day expenses, debt, and other financial obligations.&nbsp;</p><h3>Loss paid premiums&nbsp;</h3><p>Unless you have a return of premium rider, you won&#39;t get a refund on your premiums if you decide to cancel or your coverage ends.&nbsp;</p><h3>Cost of cancellation&nbsp;</h3><p>If you cancel a permanent life policy and cash out its funds, you may be subject to surrender fees and taxes on the withdrawn amount.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="Alternatives to life insurance cancelation">Alternatives to life insurance cancelation</h2><p>canceling your life insurance policy isn&#39;t ideal if you have dependents who rely on your income for financial support. Even if that isn&#39;t the case, you still lose money by paying premiums and not using your policy. Before canceling your policy, consider the following alternatives to preserve your policy or recoup your paid premiums.&nbsp;</p><h3>Lower your coverage amount&nbsp;</h3><p>If you&#39;re struggling to afford your insurance premiums, consider lowering your coverage amount. While a reduced amount may not be enough to subsidize your dependent&#39;s needs if you pass away, some coverage is better than none. Most insurers allow you to request a decrease at least once during your coverage period.</p><p>If you have a whole life insurance policy, look into reduced paid-up life insurance. This option lets you stop paying premiums and instead use your cash value to purchase a policy with a reduced death benefit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Use your cash value to cover premiums</h3><p>You can use the cash value you&#39;ve earned on your permanent policy to cover your premiums until you can afford them. Just be sure your cash value doesn&#39;t go below the minimum required amount (usually equal to your premium amount and any other policy fees), so your policy doesn&#39;t lapse.&nbsp;</p><h3>Retake your medical exam</h3><p>If your health or lifestyle (i.e., you quit smoking or avoided a high-risk hobby) has improved at least a year since your last medical exam, ask about retaking your medical exam. You may qualify for a lower-risk class hence, more affordable premiums.</p><h3>Tax-free exchange&nbsp;</h3><p>canceling a permanent life insurance policy can result in you paying taxes on the surrender amount. If your life insurance policy doesn&#39;t suit your needs (e.g., if you want a policy that offers lower premiums or better investment options), you can exchange it for a new policy without incurring tax liabilities on any investment gains.</p><p>The Internal Revenue Service permits this transaction under the 1035 exchange (also known as a like-kind exchange). If you&#39;re considering this transaction, it&#39;s best to consult a tax professional, as it&#39;s a complicated process.</p><h3 data-toc-label="Selling your policy&nbsp;">Selling your policy&nbsp;</h3><p>There are two ways you can sell your life insurance policy: (1) a viatical settlement; and (2) a life insurance settlement. They each have different requirements. For a viatical settlement, the insured individual must have a terminal medical diagnosis. However, a life insurance settlement doesn&#39;t.</p><p>In each instance, the policyholder forfeits their right to a death benefit. Therefore, if you need to leave money to your family, this might not be a good option.</p><h4>Viatical settlement&nbsp;</h4><p>A viatical settlement is when an insured individual with a terminal diagnosis is paid the death benefits from their life insurance policy.&nbsp;</p><p>Siegel gave the example of a cancer patient with a $1 million term life insurance policy who was struggling to afford medical treatment. If he simply canceled the insurance policy, he wouldn&#39;t have received any money. However, Harbor Life Settlements offered him $600,000 for his term life policy.</p><h4>Life insurance settlement</h4><p>If you don&#39;t have a terminal diagnosis and you want to sell your term life insurance policy, you can apply for a life insurance settlement with a third-party provider instead of canceling your policy. Siegel said policyholders who have <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/converting-term-life-insurance-to-permanent-life-insurance">convertible term life insurance</a>&mdash;a policy that can be converted to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-permanent-life-insurance">permanent life insurance</a>&mdash;typically qualify for life insurance settlements.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="Consulting an insurance expert&nbsp;">Consulting an insurance expert&nbsp;</h2><p>Depending on the type of life insurance you have, canceling your policy can be complicated.&nbsp;</p><p>Once you sell your term life insurance, you lose all rights to the policy, specifically the death benefit. If your family needs the death benefit, this may not be the best option for you. However, if your family is financially comfortable on their own and doesn&#39;t need the death benefit, then it may work for you.</p><p>It&#39;s wise to consult an accountant, estate attorney, or financial advisor about your financial situation and goals to determine what is best for you and the tax implications. It&#39;s worth taking the time to find the best option for you because once you&#39;ve sold your policy, you lose that coverage.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Canceling life insurance FAQs">Canceling life insurance FAQs</h2><h3 class="faq-question">Will I get any money back if I cancel my life insurance policy?</h3><p class="faq-answer">If you cancel a permanent life insurance policy, you can surrender or cash out the cash value you&#39;ve built. However, this amount may be subject to surrender charges and taxes. Term policies typically don&#39;t offer a refund unless you&#39;ve purchased a return of premium rider.</p><h3 class="faq-question">Can I cancel my life insurance policy at any time?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Yes, you can cancel a life insurance policy at any time. However, you lose life insurance protection, and your beneficiaries won&#39;t receive a death benefit if you pass away.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="faq-question">How does canceling life insurance affect my taxes?</h3><p class="faq-answer">If you surrender a policy with a cash value that exceeds the premiums paid, you&#39;ll have to pay taxes. Before canceling your policy, consult a tax professional to understand how this impacts your financial situation.</p><h3 class="faq-question">What happens if I stop paying premiums?</h3><p class="faq-answer">If you stop paying your policy&#39;s premiums, it will lapse or end. If you pass away, your beneficiaries will no longer receive a death benefit.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="faq-question">Is it possible to reinstate a policy after canceling it?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Most insurance companies allow you to reinstate your policy after cancellation. However, you may have to retake the medical exam, which may lead to increased premiums, and pay past due premiums.</p><div class="read-original">Read the original article on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/can-i-get-money-back-term-life-insurance">Business Insider</a></div>]]></content:encoded>

</ul><p>For many beginning investors, hand-picking stocks can seem quite daunting. Fortunately, investing in <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-to-invest-in-index-funds">index funds</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mutual-funds">mutual funds</a> removes the majority of the legwork, so you can get a headstart on your investing journey.&nbsp;</p><p>Both types of funds are beneficial. But first, you must consider your preferred investment strategy (<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/passive-vs-active-investing">passive vs. active</a> fund management) and the risk and return of index funds vs. mutual funds.&nbsp;</p><p>Here&#39;s what you need to know when choosing between index and mutual funds.</p><aside class="quick-tip headline-regular ignore-typography"><p><strong>Quick tip:</strong> You can access index and mutual funds by opening an account with some of the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-online-brokerage">best online brokerages</a>. Access the industry&#39;s highest-performing investment vehicles, real-time market data, and straightforward portfolio management and diversification.&nbsp;</p></aside><h2 data-toc-label="Index fund vs. mutual fund">Index fund vs. mutual fund</h2><p>Index and mutual funds provide an easy, straightforward way to diversify your portfolio across various assets without having to cherry-pick those investments one by one. The major differences are how those funds are managed and their earning potential.&nbsp;</p><p>&#34;Instead of buying shares of many individual companies, investors can purchase shares of a fund of hundreds or thousands of companies,&#34; says Matthew Willett, an investment advisor at <a href="https://wattsgwilliam.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Watts Gwilliam &amp; Co</a>. &#34;As the companies within the fund either increase in share price or decrease, the value of investors&#39; shares in the fund will change in conjunction.&#34;</p><p><iframe width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n40zk4JM0Ww"></iframe></p><h3 data-toc-label="What are index funds?">What are index funds?</h3><p>An index fund is a type of mutual fund or ETF comprised of a pool of investments that aim to mimic the performance of a certain market index. The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-the-sp-500">S&amp;P 500</a> is one of the most commonly used indices, but there are many others, including:</p><ul><li>Dow Jones Industrial Average</li><li>Nasdaq Composite Index</li><li>Wilshire 5000 Total Market Index</li><li>Russel 200 Index</li></ul><aside class="quick-tip headline-regular ignore-typography"><p><strong>Note:</strong> The Vanguard 500 Index Fund is the first-ever existing index fund. The fund tracks the S&amp;P 500 Index and contains shares of all 500 companies within it. It has delivered an average annual return of 7.84% since 2000, just under the Index&#39;s average.</p></aside><p>With an index fund, money is invested into securities within the aligned index &mdash; sometimes all of them, sometimes just a sampling. The ultimate goal is to mirror the overall index&#39;s performance and deliver similar returns to the fund&#39;s investors.</p><p>Index funds are passive investments that don&#39;t require regular trading or selling. Since professionals don&#39;t actively manage index funds, the fees are smaller, especially when compared to actively managed mutual funds.&nbsp;</p><p>Investors usually gain a small percentage annually. According to <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/commentary/article/us-equities-market-attributes-february-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2023 data</a>, the S&amp;P 500 returned 26.29% annually. Historically, annual returns have averaged 9.2%.</p><table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;" border="1"><tbody><tr><td style="width: 50%;">Pros</td><td style="width: 50%;">Cons</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 50%;"><ul><li aria-level="1"><p>Lower fees than mutual funds</p></li><li aria-level="1"><p>Allows you to diversify across many companies and sectors</p></li><li aria-level="1"><p>Slow but dependable returns over time</p></li><li aria-level="1"><p>Requires minimal research or investing know-how</p></li></ul></td><td style="width: 50%;"><ul><li aria-level="1">Not actively managed by a professional</li><li aria-level="1">No choice in who you invest in, which could be challenging if you take issue with a company&#39;s business practices</li><li aria-level="1">Short-term gains are limited because you&#39;re only invested in very small shares of each <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-to-invest-in-stocks">stock</a></li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><h3 data-toc-label="What are mutual funds?">What are mutual funds?</h3><p>A mutual fund is a company or fund that invests in a variety of assets, including stocks, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-to-buy-bonds">bonds</a>, and other assets, in the hope of beating the market. Investors purchase fund shares, thereby purchasing a stake in all companies within that portfolio.</p><p>&#34;For instance, investors who invested in the Fidelity Magellan fund during the time period Peter Lynch managed it earned an average of 29.2%,&#34; says Robert Johnson, CFA chairman and CEO of <a href="https://www.economicindexassociates.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Economic Index Associates</a>. &#34;That&#39;s more than twice what the S&amp;P 500 earned during that time.&#34;</p><p>Mutual funds come in several types, including <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-the-money-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">money market</a>, bond, target date, and stock funds (index funds fall into this category.)&nbsp;</p><table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;" border="1"><tbody><tr><td style="width: 50%;">Pros</td><td style="width: 50%;">Cons</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 50%;"><ul><li aria-level="1"><p>Allows you to diversify across many companies and sectors</p></li><li aria-level="1"><p>Could allow for higher gains, but only if managed well</p></li><li aria-level="1"><p>Several types of mutual funds to choose from</p></li></ul></td><td style="width: 50%;"><ul><li aria-level="1">Higher fees than index funds</li><li aria-level="1">Requires more research to find the right fund (and fund manager)</li><li aria-level="1">Riskier than index funds, as managers often try to beat the market</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 data-toc-label="Comparing index funds and mutual funds">Comparing index funds and mutual funds</h2><p>Both index and mutual funds can help you achieve your financial goals, but through very different approaches. With one, you&#39;ll enjoy passive, hands-off investing that offers steady returns. With the other, you&#39;ll get an actively managed fund that could sometimes beat the market.</p><h3>Management style and objectives</h3><p>Index funds are passively managed investments that aim to match the returns of broader market indexes, such as emerging markets, large caps, and broad indexes. Since these funds are usually passively managed, you can invest with some of the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-robo-advisors">best robo-advisors</a> or with the assistance of an investment professional.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, most mutual funds (aside from index funds) are actively managed. This means an investment professional will regularly sell and purchase shares within the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/investment-portfolio">investment portfolio</a> to maximize returns.</p><p>While this opens the door for higher potential gains than index funds, it also means returns are unpredictable. In many cases, actively managed funds actually underperform the market. According to <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/spiva/spiva-us-year-end-2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices </a>data, 60% of large-cap funds underperformed the S&amp;P 500 in 2023.</p><h3>Costs and fees</h3><p>When comparing index funds vs. mutual funds, fee-conscious investors often prefer indexes. Since professionals don&#39;t actively manage index funds, the fees are smaller. Index funds generally have lower turnover rates, resulting in fewer capital gains distributions. But you should still be mindful of investment minimums and expense ratios.&nbsp;</p><p>Mutual funds are more expensive than index funds, as you&#39;ll need to pay for the expense of active management by a professional.&nbsp;You&#39;ll also be subject to additional management, administrative, legal, custodial, and transfer agent expenses.&nbsp;According to the <a href="https://www.ici.org/system/files/2024-03/per30-02.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Investment Company Institute</a> (ICI), the average fee for equity mutual funds is 0.42%. On index funds, it&#39;s just 0.15%.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Making the choice: Index funds or mutual funds">Making the choice: Index funds or mutual funds</h2><p>In short, index funds are better suited for beginners and investors who prefer a hands-off investment style. These funds are more transparent, offering low-cost diversification through a long-term buy-and-hold strategy with mitigated risk and lower fees.&nbsp;</p><p>&#34;An index fund would be best for someone who did not have a lot of money and was just starting to invest,&#34; says Josh Simpson, gift planning officer at <a href="https://ksufoundation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kansas State University Foundation</a>. &#34;This would allow them to achieve diversification with their investment without having to spend hours learning how to invest.&#34;</p><p>Conversely, actively managed mutual funds offer the potential for higher returns through strategic selection of investments. Mutual fund managers aim to outperform the market benchmark, which translates to higher fees and risk than index funds.</p><p>Another aspect to consider is the performance comparison of index and mutual funds. Despite the allure of a higher return, mutual funds historically perform worse than index funds. Overall, index funds perform better, but they can&#39;t outperform the market.&nbsp;</p><p>&#34;The reason someone would choose an actively managed mutual fund is that if one can identify a fund manager that can consistently beat the market, one can accrue tremendous wealth,&#34; says Johnson.</p><p>At the end of the day, both fund types are great additions to an investment portfolio. You don&#39;t have to pick just one, either. It&#39;s common for investors to have both index and mutual funds in their portfolios to further <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-diversification">diversify</a> their holdings.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="FAQs">Index fund vs. mutual fund &mdash; Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3 class="faq-question" data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Can you invest in both index funds and mutual funds?</h3><p class="faq-answer">It&#39;s common for investors to invest in both index funds and mutual funds in their portfolios for further diversification and possibly get higher returns. Make sure you understand the benefits and risks involved in each investment vehicle before buying, though.</p><h3 class="faq-question">Which is better for long-term investing, index funds or mutual funds?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Index funds are generally considered the better option for long-term investing because of the lower fees and historically better performance. Index funds encourage a buy-and-hold strategy, preventing investors from impulsively buying and selling.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="faq-question">Are index funds less risky than mutual funds?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Index funds are usually less risky compared to mutual funds since the goal is to mimic the market rather than beat it. Index funds tend to perform better as well. However, the risk level also depends on the market or index the fund tracks.</p><h3 class="faq-question">How do you choose between an index fund and a mutual fund?</h3><p class="faq-answer">When choosing between an index fund or a mutual fund, the best investment vehicle for you depends on your preferred trading strategy, risk tolerance, expertise, and how much you&#39;re willing to spend on fees. Index funds are generally cheaper and better for passive investors. Mutual funds, on the other hand, are riskier and incur higher fees since professionals actively manage them.</p><h3 class="faq-question">Do mutual funds have higher returns than index funds?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Mutual funds aim to outperform the market, increasing the possibility of a higher return than index funds that aim to match the market. However, mutual funds don&#39;t always succeed and often underperform compared to the market.&nbsp;</p><div class="read-original">Read the original article on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/index-fund-vs-mutual-fund">Business Insider</a></div>]]></content:encoded>

<li aria-level="1">A bank account for a minor can be used to teach financial literacy and responsibility.</li>
</ul><p>If you think your child is ready to manage money, setting up a bank account can be a great next step. Not only will it give them a safe place to store their cash, but it can be an opportunity for teaching kids financial literacy through banking.</p><p>Below, we&#39;ll guide you through the process of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-do-i-need-to-open-a-bank-account">opening a bank account</a> for your child, as well as provide tips and guidelines to help them manage it.</p><h2 data-toc-label="What is a kids&#39; bank account?">What is a kids&#39; bank account?</h2><p>A kids&#39; bank account is a type of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-joint-bank-accounts">joint bank account</a> where an adult and a minor both have access.</p><p>While there aren&#39;t any federal laws that prohibit a minor from opening a bank account on their own, state laws say a bank account for a minor must be opened by someone that is 18 or older.</p><p>If you live in a state that doesn&#39;t include a minimum age requirement in the state law, most financial institutions will still have a policy that says an adult is needed to open an account.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Types of bank accounts for minors">Types of bank accounts for minors</h2><p>There are two primary joint bank account options: kids&#39; savings accounts and teens&#39; checking accounts. Depending on where you bank, you may need to open a traditional savings account or a specialized bank account tailored to children.</p><h3>Savings accounts</h3><p>A <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-banks-to-open-savings-account-for-child">kids&#39; savings account</a> is available to minors of any age.</p><p>It will typically earn a bit of interest on money deposited, but the rate will depend on the specific financial institution. Online banks and credit unions usually offer a higher rate than brick-and-mortar banks.</p><h3>Teens&#39; checking accounts</h3><p>Most banks require the child to be at least 13 years old to open a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-teen-checking-accounts">teen checking account</a>.</p><p>Teens&#39; checking accounts often include <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/atm-cards-vs-debit-cards">debit cards or ATM cards</a> so they can make purchases and withdraw cash, but still give the adult the ability to set up parental controls and account monitoring.</p><h3>Custodial accounts</h3><p>At certain financial institutions, you may also see <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-a-custodial-account">custodial accounts</a>. A custodial bank account is not the same as a traditional kids&#39; bank account. Custodial accounts are a type of investment account, and a child will obtain ownership of the account after the age of 18.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Required documentation">Required documentation</h2><p>To open a bank account for a minor, one of the individuals signing up for the account must be over the age of 18. Below, are the documents needed for a child&#39;s bank account, whether you&#39;re applying online or at a branch:</p><ul><li aria-level="1">Identification for the minor (e.g. social security card, birth certificate, school ID, passport)</li><li aria-level="1">Identification for the adult (e.g. driver&#39;s license or passport)</li><li aria-level="1">Adult&#39;s Social Security number (if you don&#39;t have a U.S. ID, refer to our list of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banks-credit-unions-for-immigrants-non-us-citizens">banks and credit unions that make it easy for immigrants and non-U.S. citizens</a>)</li><li aria-level="1">Adult&#39;s current <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/bank-account-number-on-check">bank account number</a> (Banks usually connect kids&#39; accounts to a parent&#39;s accounts)</li></ul><h2 data-toc-label="Step-by-step process">Step-by-step process</h2><h3>1. Choosing the right bank and account type</h3><p>Evaluate account features such as debit card or ATM access, parental controls, balance requirements, interest rates, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-to-avoid-bank-fees">common bank fees</a>, and the quality of the bank&#39;s mobile app.</p><p>Determine what the purpose of the account is, such as giving your child the ability to pay with a debit card or a place for them to deposit birthday money. Some financial institutions require a parent to have a connected account, so consider whether you are willing to bank there as well.</p><p>Elaine King, a CFP professional and the founder of <a href="https://familyandmoneymatters.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Family and Money Matters</a>, suggests parents introduce savings accounts as a first step to teach children about how money can grow, then potentially transition to an investment account.</p><p>Check out the financial institution&#39;s age limits as well. Once your child reaches a certain age, they will have to transfer funds to a new account, or the bank will automatically enroll them in a traditional savings account.</p><h3>2. Gather the necessary documents</h3><p>In some cases you can apply for a kids&#39; bank account online. Some banks, however, will require an in-person visit. Make sure you have everything listed above, from identification for yourself and the child to your current bank account number, handy.</p><h3>3. Complete the application and make an initial deposit</h3><p>You may be required to fund the account with an initial deposit after opening by linking an external account or making an <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/ach-transfer">ACH transfer</a>. If the account comes with a debit card, you will likely need to wait several days for it to arrive in the mail.</p><p>In the meantime, explore the account and set up parental controls, balance alerts, and other important notifications.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Teaching financial responsibility">Teaching financial responsibility</h2><p>King recommends parents lead by example to teach financial literacy. &#34;If a parent goes to the bank, teach your child to go to the bank. If the parent does online banking, then open online banking for the child,&#34; King says.</p><p>When parents set aside money for financial goals, she adds, they should have open communication with children so they can understand why money is being saved.</p><p>Parents could say, for example, &#34;Look, we have a budget of $100 to go out. But, we&#39;re going to spend $80, so $20 we&#39;re going to put it in your savings account, and that is for you to go to college,&#34; King says. That way, a child recognizes the money is being used for a specific <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/savings-goals">savings goal</a>.</p><p>Make a habit of reviewing <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-a-bank-statement">bank statements</a> with the child too, so they can identify spending patterns and maintain a budget, and be sure they understand any fees associated with the account and how to avoid them.</p><h2 data-toc-label="FAQs">Kid&#39;s banking FAQs</h2><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>What types of bank accounts can minors have?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">Minors can have access to savings accounts, checking accounts, and custodial accounts. They will need a person 18 or older to open the account with them. Checking accounts are usually only available to minors age 13 or older.</p><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>What documents are needed to open a bank account for a minor?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">Identification for both the adult and the minor (e.g. a passport, driver&#39;s license, or birth certificate), the adult&#39;s bank account information and Social Security number are usually required.</p><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>Can minors open a bank account online?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">Some national banks permit online applications when opening a bank account on behalf of a minor, but many require opening a minor&#39;s first bank account at a physical branch.</p><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>How can I teach my child financial responsibility through their bank account?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">Regularly reviewing transaction activity can help children identify spending patterns and learn <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-to-budget">how to budget</a>. Utilizing auto-save features in a savings account can help kids set and maintain financial goals.</p><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>Are there any age restrictions for opening a bank account for a minor?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">There&#39;s typically no minimum age for minors opening a joint or custodial savings account. Banks often require a minor to be 13 or older to open a joint checking account.</p><div class="read-original">Read the original article on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-to-open-a-bank-account-for-a-minor">Business Insider</a></div>]]></content:encoded>

It&#39;s got several of the same benefits, but the Sapphire Reserve&#39;s are more valuable. For example:</p><ul><li>Your points are worth 1.5 cents each when redeeming them for travel through the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/chase-ultimate-rewards-travel-portal">Chase Travel Portal</a> (instead of 1.25 cents).</li><li>The temporary DoorDash and Instacart benefits are more generous.</li><li>The card&#39;s earning rates are significantly higher in select categories.</li><li>Its primary rental car insurance covers more expensive cars than the Sapphire Preferred.</li><li>Its trip delay insurance kicks in up to six hours earlier than the Sapphire Preferred.</li></ul><p>Talking of credit card travel insurance, there&#39;s literally no credit card you can apply for that matches this card. Booking your travel with the Chase Sapphire Reserve® will give you the most peace of mind you can get without purchasing expensive coverage from a third-party <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-travel-insurance-companies">travel insurance</a> provider.</p><p>The Chase Sapphire Reserve® charges a $550 annual fee. But it can be easily offset if you use the following ongoing benefits:</p><ul><li>Up to $300 in statement credits each cardmember year toward travel purchases</li><li class="headline-regular" style="text-align: left;">Airport lounge access (Priority Pass Select membership, worth over $400 per year; access to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/chase-sapphire-lounge">Chase Sapphire Lounges</a> by The Club, access to the new <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/chase-sapphire-terrace-austin-airport-reserve-cardholders-2023-3">Chase Sapphire Terrace at Austin airport</a>)</li><li class="headline-regular" style="text-align: left;">Access to Reserved by Sapphire restaurant reservations</li><li class="headline-regular" style="text-align: left;">Up to $100 credit toward either <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-global-entry-tsa-precheck-credit-card">Global Entry, TSA PreCheck</a>, or NEXUS application fee every four years (membership is valid for five years)</li></ul><p>There&#39;s also currently an offer of two free years of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/chase-sapphire-reserve-free-lyft-pink-all-access-membership-2022-11">Lyft Pink All Access Membership</a>, with 50% off the third year.

That&#39;s worth an average of 144000 in travel when you utilize <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/american-express-membership-rewards-points-transfer-partners">Amex Membership Rewards points transfer partners</a> such as Air Canada Aeroplan, Hilton, and Delta.</p><p>The Amex Platinum is widely regarded to be the most valuable card on the market &mdash;&nbsp;<em>if</em> you can use its many benefits. It&#39;s possible to receive thousands of dollars in annual statement credits alone. For example, you&#39;ll get:</p><ul><li>Up to $200 in airline fee credits each calendar year</li><li>Up to $200 in <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-to-use-amex-platinum-uber-credit">Uber Cash credits</a> each calendar year**</li><li>Up to $200 in credits per year toward <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-to-use-amex-platinum-card-hotel-credit">prepaid hotel bookings</a> through Amex Fine Hotels and Resorts or The Hotel Collection (with a two-night minimum)</li><li>Up to $100 in Saks Fifth Avenue credits each calendar year**</li><li>$189 per year in <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-to-use-amex-platinum-clear-credit">credits for CLEAR</a>® Plus membership**</li><li>Up to $240 in annual credits (up to $20 per month) toward eligible digital subscriptions such as Peacock, Hulu, and ESPN+</li><li>$12.95 in credits each month toward Walmart+ membership**</li></ul><p>If you would organically use a few of those benefits, this card could easily save you money despite its lofty $695 annual fee.</p><p>The Amex Platinum is sort of a jack of all trades &mdash; but there is one thing this card masters: Airport lounge access. No credit card gives you a wider variety of lounges to choose from. With this card, you can freely enter:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/amex-centurion-lounges-how-to-access" rel="noopener" data-analytics-post-depth="40" data-uri="70c427b7d4b0eab25f80607afe23bfc0">Amex Centurion lounges</a>, inarguably some of the most quality lounges you&#39;ll find. You&#39;ll get free cocktails and hot meals, and sometimes even things like free massages, showers, and wine tasting.</li><li><span>Priority Pass lounges</span>, of which there are more than 1,300 locations worldwide. You can even bring two guests with you. The free snacks and alcohol generally aren&#39;t quite as fancy as Centurion Lounges, but they&#39;re still a great way to save money and enjoy the airport.</li><li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/delta-sky-club-credit-card-access" data-analytics-post-depth="40" data-uri="b7e9e8113a2724db9298f7b848b981d9">Delta Sky Club lounges</a>, as long as you&#39;re flying Delta and are carrying your Platinum Card at the front desk.</li><li>Plaza Premium lounges, with more than 100 locations around the world</li><li>Escape Lounges</li><li>Certain Lufthansa lounges, as long as you&#39;re flying Lufthansa that day.</li><li>Aspire Lounges</li><li>Select Virgin Clubhouses</li></ul><p>In other words, if you can&#39;t get enough of fancy airport lounges, no other card will better feed your addiction.</p><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/american-express-platinum-credit-card-review">American Express Platinum Card Review</a></p><h3>Best Hotel Metal Credit Card: <strong>Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant® American Express® Card</strong></h3><p>The Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant® American Express® Card comes with a welcome bonus of 185,000 Marriott Bonvoy bonus points after you use your new card to make $6,000 in purchases within the first six months of card membership. This is worth 129500 in hotel stays, based on Business Insider&#39;s valuations.</p><p>This card charges an annual fee of $650. That&#39;s nearly as jaw-dropping as the Amex Platinum annual fee &mdash; but once again, the card can easily be worthwhile for those who will maximize its perks.</p><p>For example, you&#39;ll receive:</p><ul><li>Up to $25 in statement credits&nbsp;per month for eligible purchases at restaurants worldwide (a $300 value)</li><li>Automatic Marriott Bonvoy Platinum elite status</li><li>An annual free night award worth up to 85,000 points</li><li>25 elite night credits each calendar year</li><li>Priority Pass Select airport lounge membership** (again, worth over $400 annually)</li><li>Up to $100 in Global Entry or TSA PreCheck application fee credit once every four years (memberships last five years)</li></ul><p>Business Insider estimates <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-are-points-miles-worth-value">Marriott points value</a> to be 0.7 cents each. That means an 85,000-point free night award can be worth an average of $595 if you use it on a hotel that costs at least 85,000 points.</p><p>Marriott Platinum status can also be wildly valuable, as it offers benefits like suite upgrades (when available), free breakfast, and 50% bonus points on paid Marriott stays.</p><p>All to say, if you&#39;ll maximize the monthly $25 statement credits as well as the annual free night award, you&#39;ll easily receive more value than you&#39;re paying. And with the perks like Priority Pass membership and Marriott Platinum status, you&#39;ll be many hundreds of dollars in the black.</p><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/marriott-bonvoy-brilliant-amex-card-review">Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant Amex Card Review</a></p><h3>Best Airline Metal Credit Card: <strong>Delta SkyMiles® Reserve American Express Card</strong></h3><p>The Delta SkyMiles® Reserve American Express Card is currently offering a welcome bonus of 60,000 bonus miles after you spend $5,000 in purchases on your new card in the first six months of card membership.

That&#39;s because it gives you free Delta Sky Club access (when flying Delta) and also Amex Centurion Lounge access (when flying Delta&nbsp;<em>and</em> paying for your flight with the card). Reserve card members will also receive 15 visits per year to the Delta Sky Club; to earn an unlimited number of visits each year starting on 2/1/25, the total eligible purchases on the card must equal $75,000 or more between 1/1/24 and 12/31/24, and each calendar year thereafter.</p><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/delta-reserve-review">Delta Reserve Review</a></p><h3>Best Small Business Metal Card: <strong>The Business Platinum Card® from American Express</strong></h3><p>The Business Platinum Card® from American Express currently has a welcome bonus of 150,000 Membership Rewards® points after you spend $20,000 in eligible purchases on the card within the first three months of card membership. According to Business Insider&#39;s estimation of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/amex-points-value">Amex points value</a>, that&#39;s worth 270000 in travel, on average.</p><p>Similar to the personal Amex Platinum, this card is stuffed with valuable statement credits &mdash; but they&#39;re much more business-focused. Yes, some benefits overlap, such as identical airport lounge access, up to $200 in annual airline fee credits, Gold elite status with Hilton and Marriott**, and up to $189 annually in credits for CLEAR® Plus membership**. But this card has unique offerings, too:</p><ul><li>Up to $400 in U.S. Dell credits each calendar year**</li><li>Up to $120 in credits for U.S. wireless providers each calendar year</li><li>Up to $360 in Indeed credits each calendar year**</li><li>Up to $150 in Adobe credits each calendar year**</li></ul><p>Plus, you&#39;ll get a 35% rebate when you redeem your points with your selected airline (or for business class or first class seats with <em>any</em> airline) through Amex Travel. You can receive up to 500,000 points per calendar year as a rebate.</p><p>The Amex Business Platinum charges a $695 annual fee.</p><p>You&#39;ll need a business venture &mdash; or some activity that warrants a 1099 tax form &mdash; to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/who-can-qualify-for-small-business-credit-card">qualify for a small business card</a>. Even if you don&#39;t own an enterprise with multiple employees, you may still have a perfectly legitimate small business. Things like delivering for Instacart, selling products on OfferUp, etc. can be a small business if you regularly engage in those activities.</p><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/amex-business-platinum-card-review">Amex Business Platinum Card Review</a></p><h3 data-toc-label="Best cash back metal credit card">Best Cash Back Metal Credit Card: <strong>Capital One Savor Cash Rewards Credit Card†</strong></h3><p>The Capital One Savor Cash Rewards Credit Card† comes with $300 cash bonus once you spend $3,000 on purchases within the first three months from account opening. A $300 intro offer is solid for a cash-back credit card &mdash; you won&#39;t find many with bonuses larger than that. However, you can convert the cash back you earn into much more valuable Capital One miles at a rate of 1 cent per mile.</p><p>To do this, you must also hold a Capital One miles-earning card such as the Capital One VentureOne Rewards Credit Card or the Capital One Venture&nbsp;Rewards Credit Card. Business Insider&#39;s <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-are-points-miles-worth-value">points and miles valuations</a> peg Capital One miles value at 1.7 cents each, meaning this $300 bonus is worth an average of $510 in travel.</p><p>The Capital One Savor also has one of the best earning rates in the game. You&#39;ll receive:</p><ul><li>10% cash back on Uber and Uber Eats purchases through November 14, 2024</li><li>8% cash back on Capital One Entertainment purchases</li><li>5% cash back on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel</li><li>4% cash back on dining, entertainment, and popular streaming services</li><li>3% cash back at grocery stores</li><li>1% back on all other purchases</li></ul><p>As you can see, you&#39;ll receive an above-average return for the vast majority of everyday spending. However, the card incurs a $95 annual fee, so you&#39;ll have to spend quite a bit in the card&#39;s bonus categories before it becomes a better option than a no-annual-fee credit card like the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/citi-custom-cash-card-review">Citi Custom Cash℠ Card</a> or the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/chase-freedom-unlimited-review">Chase Freedom Unlimited®</a>. It&nbsp;<em>is</em> metal, though &mdash; which not many <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-no-fee-credit-card">no-annual-fee credit cards</a> can tout.</p><p>To complement this card&#39;s highest return rate (Uber spending), you&#39;ll receive a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-capital-one-credit-cards" rel="" data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="40" data-uri="c7ba1f2dbc3ff0f283838a9246c9deaa">free Uber One membership</a> through November 14, 2024.

That equates to 75000 in value, as each point is worth 1.5 cents toward travel.</p><p>If you&#39;re specifically looking for a metal credit card, you&#39;re probably interested in showing it off &mdash; in which case, the U.S. Bank Altitude Reserve probably isn&#39;t the best card for you. That&#39;s because this card&#39;s strength is in its return rate when used as the payment method on your phone. You&#39;ll get an incredible 3 points per dollar (effectively 4.5% back) on all purchases made through a mobile wallet such as Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Samsung Pay. Because most merchants take mobile wallets nowadays, you can get 3 points per dollar for <em>just about everything</em>.</p><p>The card also earns:</p><ul><li>5 points per dollar for prepaid hotels and rental cars reserved through the Altitude Rewards Center</li><li>3 points per dollar for travel purchases</li><li>1 point per dollar on all other eligible purchases</li></ul><p>For a $400 annual fee, the U.S. Bank Altitude® Reserve Visa Infinite® Card comes with perks like:</p><ul><li>Up to $325 annual credit toward travel and dining</li><li>12-month&nbsp;Priority Pass Select membership</li><li>Excellent travel insurance (rivaling cards like the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card)</li><li>Up to $100 statement credit every four years to offset the application fee to&nbsp;Global Entry/TSA PreCheck</li></ul><p>If you spend at least $325 in travel and dining each year, this card&#39;s annual fee is effectively $75. You&#39;ll have to decide if the remaining card benefits are worth $75 to you.</p><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/us-bank-altitude-reserve-review">US Bank Altitude Reserve Review</a></p><h3>Best Metal Credit Card for Online Shopping: <strong>Prime Visa</strong></h3><p>The Prime Visa comes with a $100 Amazon gift card instantly upon approval as a Prime member.</p><p>While this card technically does not charge an annual fee, you&#39;ll need an Amazon Prime account to get the most from it. Amazon Prime costs $139 per year.</p><p>Two features make this card stand out. First are its earning rates. You&#39;ll get:</p><ul><li>5% back on purchases made through the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/chase-ultimate-rewards-travel-portal" data-analytics-post-depth="80" data-uri="5720dca2736e89a1cda520d7c036678c">Chase Travel Portal</a>, with an eligible Prime membership (new)</li><li>5% back at Amazon.com, Amazon Fresh, and Whole Foods Market, with an eligible Prime membership</li><li>2% back on local transit and commuting, including rideshare</li><li>2% back at restaurants and at gas stations</li><li>1% back on all other purchases</li></ul><p>You&#39;ll also get 10% back on rotating Amazon items. Offers are limited-time and only for Prime members.</p><p>The second notable feature is the card&#39;s ability to give you interest-free payments with Amazon. By doing this, you will not earn rewards on your card. You&#39;ll receive:</p><ul><li>6 interest-free months for purchases of $50 or more</li><li>12 interest-free months for purchases of $250 or more</li></ul><p>Similar to the U.S. Bank Altitude® Reserve Visa Infinite® Card, this card does its best work while living in your sock drawer &mdash; so you may not have as much occasion to show off your metal.</p><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/amazon-prime-rewards-visa-signature-card-review">Amazon Prime Visa Card Review</a></p><h3 data-toc-label="Best no annual fee metal credit card">Best No-Annual-Fee Metal Credit Card: <strong>U.S. Bank Altitude® Go Visa Signature® Card</strong></h3><p>The U.S. Bank Altitude® Go Visa Signature® Card is currently offering 20,000 bonus points after spending $1,000 in the first 90 days of account opening. Points are worth 1 cent each, making this bonus worth  for things like travel, cash back, and gift cards.</p><p>For a no-annual-fee credit card, the return rates for common spending are exceptional:</p><ul><li>4 points per dollar spent on dining, takeout, and restaurant delivery</li><li>2 points per dollar at grocery stores, gas stations, EV charging stations, and on grocery delivery and eligible streaming services&nbsp;</li><li>1 point per dollar on all other eligible purchases&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The card even comes with an annual statement credit worth $15 to offset your streaming expenses. When you pay for an eligible streaming service for 11 consecutive months, your credit will post during month 12. Eligible streaming services include Apple Music, Apple TV+, AT&amp;T TV NOW, Discovery+, Disney+, ESPN+, Fubo TV, Google Music, HBO Max, Hulu, Netflix, Paramount+, Peacock, SiriusXM, Slacker Radio, Sling TV, Spotify, Tidal, Vudu, and YouTube Music.</p><p>Also worth noting is that you&#39;ll receive 0% intro APR on purchases and balance transfers for the first 12 billing cycles (then 18.24% - 29.24% Variable). That&#39;s an excellent perk if you&#39;ve got a large upcoming expense that you&#39;ll need to pay off over time.</p><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/us-bank-altitude-go-card-review">US Bank Altitude Go Card Review</a></p><h3>Best Metal Credit Card for Less-Than-Perfect Credit: <strong>X1 Card</strong></h3><p>The $0 annual fee X1 Card doesn&#39;t currently offer a welcome bonus. However, you can potentially earn up to 10 points per dollar on up to 30 days of purchases by successfully referring a friend to the card.</p><p>This card is good for those with a credit history they wouldn&#39;t brag about. That&#39;s because X1 takes into account more than just your credit score when deciding if you are a good candidate for the card. It looks at your employment income to see how much money you make.</p><p>The X1 Card can earn points quickly with a little bit of strategy. You&#39;ll get a flat 2 points per dollar on all spending. But when you spend at least $1,000 on purchases each month, your earnings are boosted to 3 points per dollar (capped at $7,500 in spending, then back to 2x).</p><p>You can also earn bonus points by taking advantage of &#34;Boosts&#34; inside the X1 app. They are targeted toward certain merchants and spending categories, and they rotate frequently.</p><p>Interestingly, the card allows you to create infinite virtual credit cards, each with custom expiration dates, usage limits, etc. This is great for those who find themselves signing up for free trials and forgetting to cancel &mdash; you can simply create a virtual card for the free trial and set the card to expire before the trial ends.</p><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/x1-card-review">X1 Card Review</a></p><h2 data-toc-label="FAQs">Benefits of Choosing a Metal Credit Card</h2><p>Metal cards historically represented prestige, luxury, and wealth. But now, they are available for various products and have lost a little bit of their prestigious appeal.&nbsp;</p><p>Beyond feeling fancy, there aren&#39;t many physical benefits to metal cards compared to plastic. You&#39;ll have slightly heavier wallets, some bragging rights amongst friends, and a more durable tool to use as a ruler when drawing straight lines in your notebook.</p><p>But it&#39;s always fun to have at least one, and these top credit cards make it easy to add a little joy in your wallet without extra effort.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="FAQs">How to Choose a Metal Credit Card</h2><p>Never choose a credit card solely for its external appearance. Instead, evaluate any potential credit card against your personal spending habits and upcoming financial goals.</p><p>If you plan to use your card primarily through Apple Wallet, for example, a physical card that&#39;s made of metal might be completely wasted on you.</p><p>But if you frequently treat business clients to fancy dinners, breaking out a sleek metal card could be the right icebreaker for easing into delicate financial conversations. Just know that metal cards can be very eye-catching, so be prepared to discuss your choice and the benefits you derive from that card in great detail to the right crowd.&nbsp;</p><h3>Customizing a Metal Credit Card</h3><p>Some metal cards can be further customized. The Platinum Card® from American Express, for example, comes in three different designs: A classic silver, or two designs with colorful artist-commissioned details over a silver background.</p><h2 data-toc-label="FAQs">Tips for Maximizing the Value of Your Metal Credit Card</h2><p>You can&#39;t dispose of a metal credit card like you&#39;d cut up a plastic card. Instead, you&#39;ll usually receive a prepaid envelope from your bank if you get a new card. You can also bring your card to a local bank branch and ask them to destroy it for you.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="FAQs">Metal Credit Card Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3 class="faq-question">Who offers metal credit cards?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Many major banks issue at least one metal card: American Express, Citi, Chase, Capital One, and U.S. Bank have plenty to choose from.</p><h3 class="faq-question">What are the benefits of using a metal credit card?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Metal cards are striking additions to any wallet, historically reserved for premium credit cards only. These days, metal cards can be fun to show off when you pay a bill.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="faq-question">Do all metal credit cards have a high fee?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Metal cards historically come with sky high annual fees to offset the expensive premium benefits they offer. However, some current metal cards don&#39;t even come with an annual fee, like the U.S. Bank Altitude® Go Visa Signature® Card.</p><h3 class="faq-question">Can I get a metal card with no foreign transaction fee?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Many metal credit cards are designed with travelers in mind, so they don&#39;t charge foreign transaction fees.</p><h3 class="faq-question">Are there metal credit cards that offer cash back?</h3><p class="faq-answer">The metal-based Capital One Savor Cash Rewards Credit Card† and the Prime Store card both offer cash-back rewards.</p><h3 class="faq-question">How heavy are metal credit cards?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Popular metal credit cards can vary from 13 to 22 grams in weight.</p><h3 class="faq-question">How do you destroy a metal credit card?</h3><p class="faq-answer">To <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-to-get-rid-of-metal-credit-cards">destroy a metal credit card</a>, you can&#39;t just feed it through the paper shredder like you can with a plastic card. Without involving a vise grip and a circular saw, the bank gives you a couple of options for how you can dispose of a canceled card &mdash; namely, either mail it back to the bank (they will send you a prepaid envelope) or drop it off at a local branch.</p><h3 class="faq-question">Are metal credit cards better?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Metal credit cards are not necessarily better. The material of a credit card does not necessarily indicate its prestige. Even some no-annual-fee credit cards are made out of metal. There are plenty of non-metal cards that top the charts in their respective class.</p><h2>Why You Should Trust Us: How We Chose the Best Metal Credit Cards</h2><p>We chose the metal credit cards on our list because they have one or more of the following attributes:</p><ul><li>A sizable welcome bonus</li><li>Above-average return rates</li><li>Valuable ongoing benefits</li></ul><p>Business Insider has already painstakingly ranked just about every credit card in existence by category (<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-cash-back-credit-cards">best cash back cards</a>, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-travel-rewards-credit-cards">best travel credit cards</a>, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-no-fee-credit-card">best no annual fee cards</a>, etc.).

<li>Credit card rewards come in all types, from cash back, airline miles, and hotel points.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Transferable points are the most flexible because you can redeem them in so many different ways.</li>
<li>Transferring points to airline and hotel loyalty programs is the best way to get the most value.</li>
</ul><h2 data-pm-slice="1 1 [&#34;table&#34;,{},&#34;table_row&#34;,{},&#34;table_cell&#34;,{&#34;colspan&#34;:1,&#34;rowspan&#34;:1,&#34;colwidth&#34;:[120]}]" data-toc-label="Introduction to Transferable Credit Card Rewards">Introduction to Transferable Credit Card Rewards</h2><p>Among people well versed in <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-rewards-credit-cards" rel="noopener">rewards credit cards</a>, there&#39;s a bit of common knowledge: Not all rewards points are created equal. That&#39;s because even though different cards offer &#34;points&#34; or &#34;miles&#34; for every dollar you spend, those points can be very different things, with <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-are-points-miles-worth-value" rel="noopener">very different values</a>.</p><p>Each bank and frequent flyer program has its own rewards currency that can be used in various ways. That makes it complicated when it&#39;s time to choose a credit card. Two cards could offer double points on purchases, but those points could be good for very different things &mdash; and one set of rewards could be a lot more valuable than the other.</p><p>Let&#39;s unpack why transferable points are the most valuable rewards you can earn.</p><h3 data-pm-slice="1 1 [&#34;table&#34;,{},&#34;table_row&#34;,{},&#34;table_cell&#34;,{&#34;colspan&#34;:1,&#34;rowspan&#34;:1,&#34;colwidth&#34;:[120]}]">What Are Transferable Rewards?</h3><p>With some credit cards, you can transfer the points you earn through your everyday spending to airline and hotel partners. These rewards are called transferable points.</p><p>A few banks and rewards programs offer transferable points, but arguably the two most robust are <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/guide-earning-using-chase-ultimate-rewards-points" rel="noopener">Chase Ultimate Rewards®</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-ways-to-earn-use-amex-points" rel="noopener">American Express Membership Rewards</a>. The other notable programs are <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/guide-earning-using-citi-thankyou-points" rel="noopener">Citi ThankYou Rewards</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-to-earn-and-redeem-capital-one-miles" rel="noopener">Capital One miles</a>.</p><p>For example, if you&#39;re using Chase cards that earn the bank&#39;s Ultimate Rewards points, you can <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/chase-ultimate-rewards-points-transfer-partners" rel="noopener">transfer those points</a> to any of 11 airline frequent flyer programs and three hotel loyalty programs. The Ultimate Rewards program&#39;s airline partners include carriers in all three of the major airline alliances, which effectively means that you can book frequent flyer tickets &mdash; also known as &#34;award flights&#34; &mdash; on most airlines.</p><h2 data-pm-slice="1 1 [&#34;table&#34;,{},&#34;table_row&#34;,{},&#34;table_cell&#34;,{&#34;colspan&#34;:1,&#34;rowspan&#34;:1,&#34;colwidth&#34;:[120]}]" data-toc-label="How to Transfer Credit Card Rewards">How to Transfer Credit Card Rewards</h2><h3 data-pm-slice="1 1 [&#34;table&#34;,{},&#34;table_row&#34;,{},&#34;table_cell&#34;,{&#34;colspan&#34;:1,&#34;rowspan&#34;:1,&#34;colwidth&#34;:[120]}]">Understanding Transfer Ratios</h3><p>In many cases, it can be better (read: cheaper) to book flights through an airline&#39;s frequent flyer program instead of exchanging points for cash back and using that money to buy plane tickets, or exchanging your points for a statement credit to &#34;erase&#34; travel purchases.</p><p>Cash prices for flights change all the time thanks to complicated airline pricing algorithms. When you exchange points for cash or as a statement credit, generally the best return you can get is 1 cent for each point applied toward the price of the ticket when you booked it.</p><h3 data-pm-slice="1 1 [&#34;table&#34;,{},&#34;table_row&#34;,{},&#34;table_cell&#34;,{&#34;colspan&#34;:1,&#34;rowspan&#34;:1,&#34;colwidth&#34;:[120]}]">Maximizing Points on Ticket Prices</h3><p>In many cases, award ticket pricing is different, with the disclaimer that each airline&#39;s system varies significantly. For this example, let&#39;s focus on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-to-earn-use-united-mileageplus-miles">United Airlines</a> &mdash; a partner of Chase&#39;s Ultimate Rewards program &mdash; and the way that its MileagePlus frequent flyer program works.</p><p>Let&#39;s say you wanted to travel round-trip from Chicago to Munich, Germany. That ticket could cost more than $1,200 depending on which month you travel.</p><p>If you exchanged your Chase Ultimate Rewards points for cash to purchase the ticket, or if you wanted to use fixed-value points worth 1 cent each &mdash; such as miles you can earn with the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/capital-one-venture-card-review">Capital One Venture&nbsp;Rewards Credit Card</a> &mdash; you would need 120,000 points/miles to cover the whole trip.</p><p>However, if you transferred your Chase Ultimate Rewards points to United, you could potentially <em>book the same flight for half as many points.</em></p><p>The lowest-level award ticket from the mainland US to anywhere in Europe only costs 30,000 MileagePlus miles each way, or 60,000 total for a round-trip. That saves you a ton of points, or means you can afford the trip sooner. The difference is even starker if you want to fly in business or first class, something that might be completely unattainable with cash, but doable with points.</p><p>To use the same United Airlines example between Chicago and Munich, a business-class ticket on this route starts at around $4,600 round-trip. That would cost 460,000 fixed-value points, or points exchanged for cash back, if you wanted to use them to &#34;erase&#34; the purchase from your statement.</p><p>However, a business-class saver ticket (if you can find saver availability &mdash; it&#39;s typically scarce) starts at 60,000 miles each way, or 120,000 miles round-trip for the same exact flight &mdash; a quarter of how many miles or points you would have needed with cash back or a statement credit.</p><p><em></em></p><figure><em><img src="https://i.insider.com/62389ec0927f4a001886cdf1?format=jpeg" height="724" width="1086" charset="" alt="United Polaris cabin."/><figcaption><p class="copyright">EQRoy/Shutterstock</p></figcaption></em></figure><h2 data-pm-slice="1 1 [&#34;table&#34;,{},&#34;table_row&#34;,{},&#34;table_cell&#34;,{&#34;colspan&#34;:1,&#34;rowspan&#34;:1,&#34;colwidth&#34;:[120]}]" data-toc-label="Bank Travel Portals">Bank Travel Portals</h2><p>The catch is that most airlines only make a few saver-level tickets available for each flight &mdash; and they make them available at various points before traveling &mdash; so you may not be able to find saver seats right away. Also, it&#39;s possible there will be a time when the cash price of a coach ticket in the above example is less than $600.</p><p>In that case, transferring your points to United and getting a saver-level round-trip for 60,000 miles is actually not the best deal. Fortunately, Chase gives you another great option to redeem points for travel in those cases.</p><p>Chase operates a travel-booking service as part of its website. If you use the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/chase-ultimate-rewards-travel-portal">Chase Travel Portal℠</a> &mdash; either online or by phone &mdash; to purchase airline tickets or make hotel reservations, you get 1 cent per point in value when you have no-annual-fee cards like the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/chase-freedom-flex-credit-card-review">Chase Freedom Flex℠</a> or <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/chase-freedom-unlimited-review">Chase Freedom Unlimited®</a>.</p><p>But when you have the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/chase-sapphire-preferred-card-review">Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card</a> or <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/chase-ink-business-preferred-card-review">Ink Business Preferred® Credit Card</a>, you get a 25% bonus in value. In other terms, instead of each point being worth 1 cent, they&#39;re worth 1.25 cents. That means that if you were looking at a $600 flight from Chicago to Munich, you would only need 48,000 Chase points, fewer than you would need for a saver ticket if you were to transfer the points to United.</p><p>Even better, if you have the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/chase-sapphire-reserve-credit-card-review">Chase Sapphire Reserve®</a>, your points are worth 1.5 cents each (50% bonus) when you redeem them through Chase Travel &mdash; the same ticket above would only cost 40,000 points.</p><p>American Express doesn&#39;t offer fixed bonuses when using points to book travel through the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/american-express-travel">Amex Travel portal</a>, but there are occasional promotions or bonuses for certain flights.</p><h2 data-pm-slice="1 1 [&#34;table&#34;,{},&#34;table_row&#34;,{},&#34;table_cell&#34;,{&#34;colspan&#34;:1,&#34;rowspan&#34;:1,&#34;colwidth&#34;:[120]}]" data-toc-label="Choosing the Right Card for Transferable Rewards">Choosing the Right Card for Transferable Rewards</h2><p>The best transferable-point credit card for you depends on what credit card rewards program is most appealing. Make sure to research the transfer partners and redemption options available with each. Below, you&#39;ll find some of the top options with each major program.</p><h3>American Express Membership Rewards</h3><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-american-express-cards">American Express issues personal and small-business cards</a> that earn Membership Rewards points.

</ul><p>Delta is one of the world&#39;s largest airlines. If you live in a hub city such as Atlanta, New York, or Seattle, this airline may be your carrier of choice. <em>Amex is a Business Insider partner.</em></p><p>Since Delta&#39;s route network is so ubiquitous within the U.S. &mdash; and because Delta SkyMiles are (relatively) easy to get &mdash; there are many different options for redeeming your miles with Delta and its partners in the SkyTeam alliance, although not all of them offer a good value.</p><h2>Delta SkyMiles Guide 2024</h2><p>There are a number of ways for you to earn and redeem Delta SkyMiles. This article takes a quick look at the most popular methods.&nbsp;</p><aside class="quick-tip headline-regular ignore-typography"><p>To find out how much Delta miles are worth (along with 29 other airline, hotel, and bank programs), check out Personal Finance Insider&#39;s guide to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-are-points-miles-worth-value" data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="40" data-uri="86046fc9cb71b24b1404b8d3a265aa5c">points and miles valuations</a> for 2024.</p></aside><h2 data-toc-label="How to Earn Delta SkyMiles">How to Earn Delta SkyMiles</h2><h3><strong>Earn Delta miles by flying Delta and its partners</strong></h3><p>The most obvious way to earn Delta SkyMiles is to fly on Delta. Within the past several years, Delta has changed its earning structure, so the number of redeemable miles that you earn on most Delta flights is calculated by your elite status and the total cost of the fare, as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>General SkyMiles Members:</strong> 5 miles per dollar</li><li><strong>Silver Members:</strong> 7 miles per dollar</li><li><strong>Gold Members:</strong> 8 miles per dollar</li><li><strong>Platinum Members:</strong> 9 miles per dollar</li><li><strong>Diamond Members:</strong> 11 miles per dollar</li></ul><p>Delta has more than 20 airline partners both in the SkyTeam airline alliance and non-alliance partners. You can choose to credit flights on these partner airlines to Delta by putting your SkyMiles membership information into your flight itinerary. The number of SkyMiles that you will earn depends on your route and the fare class of the ticket that you&#39;ve purchased, and vary by partner.</p><h3><strong>Earn miles from American Express Delta and Membership Rewards credit cards</strong></h3><p>Another way to quickly earn a lot of Delta SkyMiles is by earning welcome offers on American Express co-branded <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-delta-credit-cards">Delta credit cards</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Delta offers the following personal credit cards:</p><h3><strong>Delta Gold Card&nbsp;</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">If you fly Delta occasionally, the Delta SkyMiles® Gold American Express Card<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/gold-delta-skymiles-amex-card-review"></a> is a great choice.</p><p dir="ltr">You&#39;ll earn 40,000 bonus miles after you spend $2,000 in purchases on your new card in your first six months of card membership when you start, and receive a free first checked bag on Delta flights for yourself and up to eight companions on the same reservation (worth $30 per bag), priority boarding, a 20% discount on inflight purchases, 15% off award flights on Delta, and a $200 Delta flight credit after you spend $10,000 on the card in a calendar year.

This holds especially true if you live at or near a Delta hub or focus city.&nbsp;</p><p>If you&#39;re an eligible American Express Delta cardholder, you have the option to either pay for your ticket directly with SkyMiles or to use Delta&#39;s Pay With Miles&nbsp;feature. With Pay With Miles, you can lower the cost of your ticket by $50 for 5,000 miles, $100 for 10,000 miles, and so on. Indeed, you can often get better than 1 cent per mile value from your SkyMiles, but this serves as a good minimum value redemption for SkyMiles.</p><p>Delta also added a benefit to most of its co-branded credit cards called <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/delta-amex-credit-cards-takeoff-15-save-award-flights-2023-2">TakeOff 15</a>, which gets you a 15% discount on award flight prices when you use miles to book a Delta itinerary. If you have an eligible card, this is an easy way to make your miles go further&mdash;just note that you need to be signed in to your Delta account to take advantage, and you can&#39;t combine this discount with certificates, gift cards, or Pay With Miles.</p><p>Remember too that if you&#39;re short on Delta SkyMiles, you can <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/american-express-membership-rewards-points-transfer-partners">transfer American Express Membership Rewards points</a> 1:1 to Delta to top off your account.</p><p><strong>Delta award sales</strong></p><p>Several years ago, Delta was the first airline to remove its award chart. Now, the price of a flight in SkyMiles varies based on the route, the date, the time, the number of stops, and anything else that Delta decides. Oftentimes the price in SkyMiles correlates to the cash price of a flight, though not always.</p><p>Delta does release sales now and again (often unadvertised, unfortunately), with which you can find some pretty great deals on redemptions for both domestic and international awards.</p><p><strong>Use miles to fly on partners</strong></p><p>Because Delta is a member of the SkyTeam alliance, you can use your Delta miles to fly on Delta&#39;s alliance and other partners such as Air France, China Eastern, Air Tahiti Nui, and Korean Air.</p><h3 data-toc-label="Other Ways to Use Delta SkyMiles">Other Ways to Use Delta Miles</h3><p>In addition to redeeming Delta SkyMiles for flights on Delta and its partners, there are also a few other ways to use them. You can use your miles for magazines, gift cards, upgrading your seat, and even other experiences. These are almost always a worse value than using your miles to fly on Delta or partner airlines, and are not recommended.</p><h2 data-toc-label="FAQs">Delta SkyMiles Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2><h3 class="faq-question">Do Delta miles expire?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Delta miles do not expire. Even if it&#39;s been years since you&#39;ve earned or redeemed your miles, you won&#39;t have to worry about them disappearing on you.</p><h3 class="faq-question">What is the best credit card to get Delta SkyMiles?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Several credit cards are great for earning Delta SkyMiles. The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/gold-delta-skymiles-amex-card-review">Delta Gold Card</a> comes with priority boarding and a free checked bag in addition to elevated rewards per dollar on Delta purchases.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="faq-question">How much are 70,000 Delta SkyMiles worth?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Personal Finance Insider values Delta SkyMiles at 1.1 cents apiece, on average. Thus, a welcome bonus of 70,000 Delta SkyMiles could be worth $770 in travel rewards, or more if you can find a better redemption opportunity.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="faq-question">Is the Gold or Platinum Delta Amex better?</h3><p class="faq-answer">The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/gold-delta-skymiles-amex-card-review">Delta Gold Card</a> offers good value for infrequent Delta travelers. However, Delta fans can consider the Platinum card for its annual companion certificate, or even the top-tier Reserve, which comes with airport lounge access.&nbsp;</p><div class="read-original">Read the original article on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-to-earn-and-redeem-delta-miles">Business Insider</a></div>]]></content:encoded>

This multiplier adds up quickly if you frequently dine out or grocery-shop for the household. &nbsp;</p><p>Our guides to the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-american-express-cards">best American Express credit cards</a> and the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-american-express-business-card">best American Express business credit cards</a> break down each card&#39;s benefits and earning rates so you can easily compare which one is best for you.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="Redeem">Redeeming Membership Rewards points</h2><p>When you open an American Express card, you can often earn a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-current-credit-card-signup-bonuses">large welcome bonus offer</a>, in addition to being able to rack up points quickly through your normal, everyday spending. This initial boost, often called a sign-up bonus, can jumpstart your way toward building a stash of Amex points for exciting redemptions we&#39;ll outline below.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of the options below offer the potential for fantastic value, but most non-travel choices aren&#39;t the best ways to redeem Amex Membership Rewards. We&#39;ll tell you why in each section below.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Travel options through Amex Travel</strong></h3><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/american-express-travel">Amex Travel</a> is essentially a travel-booking website operated by American Express. It works similarly to travel booking sites like Expedia or Orbitz. The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/american-express-travel" rel="noopener">American Express Travel</a> portal allows you to book flights, hotels, car rentals, cruises, and more with your Membership Rewards points.&nbsp;</p><p>Airfare is the best option when you&#39;re paying with points. When you book a flight through Amex Travel, you&#39;ll get a value of 1 cent per point. You may also find &#34;Insider Fares,&#34; which generally offer a slightly better value &mdash; a lot of these fares are on Delta.</p><p>Unfortunately, if you want to book anything else through the Amex Travel portal &mdash; like hotels, cruises, rental cars, or vacation packages &mdash; you&#39;ll only get 0.7 cents per point. The exception is Amex Fine Hotels and Resorts, which gets you 1 cent per point.</p><p>This is in contrast to Chase, which offers the same price for anything through its <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/chase-ultimate-rewards-travel-portal">Chase Travel Portal℠</a> &mdash; 1 cent per point if you have a basic card like the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/chase-freedom-unlimited-review">Chase Freedom Unlimited®</a> or <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/chase-freedom-flex-credit-card-review">Chase Freedom Flex℠</a>, 1.25 cents per point if you have the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/chase-sapphire-preferred-card-review">Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card</a> or the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/chase-ink-business-preferred-card-review">Ink Business Preferred® Credit Card</a>, or 1.5 cents per point if you have the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/chase-sapphire-reserve-credit-card-review">Chase Sapphire Reserve®</a>.</p><h3><strong>Bid for upgrades on your next flight</strong></h3><p>American Express lets you use points to bid for discounted upgrades to first class, business class, and premium economy on participating airlines.</p><p>A number of airlines offer an option to place cash bids on upgrades before your flight &mdash; if there are available seats in premium cabins, you can snag them at a potentially steep discount. Most airlines that offer this manage it through a third-party service called Plusgrade.</p><p>Under the Amex partnership with Plusgrade, you can use Membership Rewards points to place bids on over 20 airlines, including Aeromexico, Air Canada, Etihad, Qantas, Ethiopian Airlines, and TAP Portugal.</p><p>Each Membership Rewards point is worth $0.01 toward a bid. So 10,000 points are worth $100 &mdash; a solid valuation. The best value from points, however, can be had by transferring them to one of Amex&#39;s airline or hotel partners, and booking flights or hotel stays that way.</p><p>To bid for an upgrade using your Membership Rewards points, visit americanexpress.com/upgrade and enter your reservation details. If your bid is accepted, you&#39;ll receive an email.</p><h3><strong>Shopping with points at partner retailers including Amazon and Best Buy</strong></h3><p>When you check out online at a growing list of major retailers and enter your American Express card number, you can opt to pay in part or in full with points.</p><p>Merchants that currently let you pay with Amex points at checkout include:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/amazon-credit-card-points">Amazon</a></li><li>Best Buy</li><li>Dell.com</li><li>Newegg</li><li>PayPal</li><li>RiteAid</li><li>Saks Fifth Avenue</li><li>Staples</li></ul><h3><strong>Gift cards and statement credits</strong></h3><p>You can exchange Membership Rewards points for cash or gift cards, but keep in mind that this is usually a pretty terrible value compared to other redemption options.&nbsp;</p><p>Different merchant gift cards have different prices and values for your points. Some offer a not-horrible 1 cent per point &mdash; meaning a $25 gift card costs 2,500 points &mdash; but the others are as low as 0.5 cents per point &mdash; so that $25 gift card would cost 5,000 points.</p><p>You can also redeem points as statement credits against specific charges &mdash; essentially, cash back used to pay your card. However, this is a similarly poor value, only offering 0.6 cents per point.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Buy merchandise through Amex or tickets through Ticketmaster&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Amex offers a shopping portal that has a wide range of different products, all of which can be purchased with Membership Rewards points. However, you&#39;ll only get 0.5 cents per point (unless there&#39;s a promotional offer), so if you were set on using points for merchandise, you&#39;d be better off going through a shopping partner like Amazon, or possibly buying a gift card.</p><p>To redeem points at Ticketmaster, you&#39;ll need to call Amex after using your card to pay for your Ticketmaster purchase, then use points at a rate of 0.5 cents each to cover the charge.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Other ways to use American Express points</strong></h3><p>There are a few other, little-known options for redeeming your American Express rewards, including:</p><ul><li>Donating points to charity through JustGiving (0.7 cents per point)</li><li>Redeeming points for food delivery through GrubHub or Seamless (0.7 cents per point)</li><li>Paying for NYC Taxi fare with points (1 cent per point)<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/donate-credit-card-rewards-points-to-charity" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></li><li>Using points to offset the excise tax for transferring points to a U.S. airline (0.5 cents per point)</li></ul><h2 data-toc-label="Maximize">Maximizing Membership Rewards points</h2><p>Maximizing value with American Express Membership Rewards can be extremely easy. These are some of our favorite ways to stretch your points.&nbsp;</p><h3 data-toc-label="Transfer"><strong>Transfer to airline and hotel partners</strong></h3><p>As with any <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/transferable-credit-card-points-best-rewards-to-earn">transferable points</a> program, the best potential value you can get is from transferring your Amex points to a partner program. You can <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/american-express-membership-rewards-points-transfer-partners">transfer American Express Membership Rewards points</a> to 17 airline and three hotel loyalty program partners, mostly at a 1:1 ratio. Amex occasionally runs transfer bonuses that let you get even more value for your points when you move them to certain partners.</p><p>This is particularly valuable for flying, as opposed to hotel stays. In many cases, the cash price and the miles price of a ticket aren&#39;t linked, so it&#39;s possible to get exponentially increased value from your points by transferring them and booking an award ticket instead. That means potentially being able to fly long-haul in first or business class with points, among other things.</p><p>Ultimately, remember to compare pricing between the Amex Travel Portal and how many points you would need to transfer to a frequent flyer program for an award flight. Because award tickets sometimes have cash taxes and fees &mdash; occasionally rising into the hundreds of dollars &mdash; it&#39;s good to compare.</p><aside class="quick-tip headline-regular ignore-typography"><h3><strong>Amex Transfer Partners</strong></h3><ul><li>Aer Lingus: 1,000 points = 1,000 miles</li><li>Aeromexico: 1,000 points = 1,600 miles</li><li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-to-earn-use-air-canada-aeroplan-miles-points">Air Canada Aeroplan</a>: 1,000 points = 1,000 miles</li><li>Air France-KLM Flying Blue: 1,000 points = 1,000 miles</li><li>ANA Mileage Club: 1,000 points = 1,000 miles</li><li>Asia Miles: 1,000 points = 1,000 miles</li><li>Avianca: 1,000 points = 1,000 miles</li><li>British Airways: 1,000 points = 1,000 miles</li><li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-to-earn-and-redeem-delta-miles" data-analytics-post-depth="0" data-uri="b79c0416cb35ccafe3099861d45e0961">Delta SkyMiles</a>: 1,000 points = 1,000 miles</li><li>Emirates Skywards: 1,000 points = 1,000 miles</li><li>Etihad Airways: 1,000 points = 1,000 miles</li><li>Hawaiian Airlines: 1,000 points = 1,000 miles</li><li>Iberia: 1,000 points = 1,000 miles</li><li>JetBlue: 250 points = 200 miles</li><li>Qantas: 500 points = 500 miles</li><li>Singapore Airlines: 1,000 points = 1,000 miles</li><li>Virgin Atlantic: 1,000 points = 1,000 miles</li><li>Choice Privileges: 1,000 points = 1,000 hotel points</li><li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-to-earn-redeem-hilton-honors-points">Hilton Honors</a>: 1,000 points = 2,000 hotel points</li><li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-to-earn-redeem-marriott-points" data-analytics-post-depth="0" data-uri="fd21a560134a39290e6e8304bd40e05d">Marriott Bonvoy</a>: 1,000 points = 1,000 hotel points</li></ul></aside><h3><strong>Special promotions and offers</strong></h3><p>From time to time, Amex offers some limited-time promotions that can help you get even more value out of your points. Sometimes you can save up to $80 at Amazon by using a single Membership Rewards point at checkout, or Amex offers transfer bonuses where you can send points to airline or hotel partners at an elevated rate of 20% to 30% more value.&nbsp;</p><aside class="quick-tip headline-regular ignore-typography"><h3 data-toc-label="Value">How Much are Amex Points Worth?</h3><p>Amex Membership Rewards are among the most valuable travel rewards you can earn. These points offer a high upside thanks to Amex&#39;s lucrative roster of 17 airline and three hotel transfer partners, as well as a respectable value floor for eligible cardholders who book travel directly through Amex.</p><p>These features give Membership Rewards points an average redemption value of 1.8 cents per point in <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-are-points-miles-worth-value#amex-membership-rewards-points-value" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Business Insider&#39;s most recent valuations</a>. Read on to learn which redemption options you should target and avoid in order to maximize your return.</p></aside><h2 data-toc-label="Compare">Comparison with other rewards programs</h2><p>Amex Membership Rewards are extremely popular, but they aren&#39;t the only good loyalty program &#34;currency.&#34; Here are some other major players you should know about, as well as what makes them stand out.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Membership Rewards vs. other credit card points programs&nbsp;</strong></h3><p><strong>Chase Ultimate Rewards</strong></p><p>Amex is most frequently compared to Chase, which operates the popular <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/chase-ultimate-rewards-travel-portal">Chase Ultimate Rewards</a> loyalty program.</p><p>Chase Ultimate Rewards and Amex Membership Rewards are extremely similar in scope and flexibility, and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-are-points-miles-worth-value">share the same average and high point values</a> by our calculations. Both rewards programs share many of the same hotel and airline partners including Air Canada, Air France/KLM, Emirates, and Singapore Airlines as well as Marriott.&nbsp;</p><aside class="quick-tip headline-regular ignore-typography"><p>Business Insider estimates that Amex Membership Rewards and Chase Ultimate Rewards are both worth 1.8 cents apiece, on average, or 2.2 cents apiece for a high-value redemption.&nbsp;</p></aside><p>Points cannot be used interchangeably between the two programs, since Amex and Chase are competitors and do not share currencies.&nbsp;</p><p>That being said, cardholders who earn rewards under both programs can leverage them together very efficiently in many cases. For example, both airlines partner with Air Canada as a points transfer partner. If you need a certain number of miles for an award ticket but don&#39;t have enough in one account, you can top up your Air Canada mileage account using points from the other credit card program.&nbsp;</p><p>Chase Ultimate Rewards can also be redeemed many other ways, just like Amex points.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Citi ThankYou Points</strong></p><p>Citi is the third member of the original trifecta of credit card loyalty programs, before Capital One, Bilt Rewards, and Wells Fargo joined the scene. Citi-branded credit cards earn <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/guide-earning-using-citi-thankyou-points">Citi ThankYou points</a> worth 1.6 cents apiece according to Business Insider valuations. Citi points can be transferred to 19 different airlines and hotel partners or used for many of the same alternative redemptions as the programs mentioned above.&nbsp;</p><p>Citi ThankYou Rewards are worth 1.6 cents apiece on average, according to our valuations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Capital One</strong></p><p>Capital One was one of the newer credit card issuers to enter the transferrable rewards currency game after the three major players began decades ago. Capital One-branded consumer and business credit cards earn <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-to-earn-and-redeem-capital-one-miles">Capital One Miles</a>, which can be transferred to more than a dozen airlines and hotel chains. Once again, Capital One Miles can also be redeemed in many other ways including for gift cards, statement credits, and more.&nbsp;<br/><br/>Capital One Miles are unique because they also can be used to &#34;erase&#34; travel-related purchases on Miles-earning credit cards. Just pay for a flight, hotel, or similar eligible expense using the rewards card, then choose the &#34;pay with Miles&#34; option when you go to pay your credit card outstanding balance. You&#39;ll see the points as a credit on your statement, effectively negating your out-of-pocket cash flow.&nbsp;</p><p>Capital One Miles are worth 1.7 cents apiece on average, according to our valuations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Bilt</strong></p><p>Bilt is a newcomer on the credit card rewards currency scene, but the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/bilt-points-value">Bilt Rewards</a> program is already a robust competitor to the ones listed above. Bilt boasts well over a dozen airline and hotel transfer partners as well, and offers loyalty program members many fun ways to earn Bilt Points including free trivia contests and rotating promotions on Bilt Rent Day, which falls on the first of each month.&nbsp;</p><p>Bilt offers a few unique opportunities that competitors do not. Bilt members don&#39;t have to be Bilt cardholders to earn points, and Bilt Points can be used to pay rent on a Bilt Mastercard® or saved toward a down payment on a home through select mortgage lenders.&nbsp;</p><p>Bilt Points are worth 1.65 cents apiece on average, according to our valuations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Wells Fargo</strong></p><p>Wells Fargo is the newest issuer to join the ranks of flexible credit card reward currencies. The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/wells-fargo-autograph-journey-credit-card-review">Wells Fargo Rewards program</a> is brand-new as of April 2024, so little information is known yet beyond the five airline and one hotel partner transfer opportunities. Cardholders who earn Wells Fargo Rewards points can redeem them through new transfer partners, pool their points between friends and family, or continue to use them as cash back.&nbsp;</p><p>Wells Fargo points are worth 1.3 cents apiece on average, according to our valuations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Unique benefits of Membership Rewards</strong></h3><p>Amex Membership Rewards hold their own against these competing rewards because Amex has a reputation for luxury in the travel space. Amex cardholders can use their points to offset cash purchases through <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/american-express-travel">American Express Travel</a>, and some popular Amex credit cards come with generous travel benefits such as complimentary access to the famous <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/amex-centurion-lounges-how-to-access">Amex Centurion Lounges</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Travelers who value luxe, exclusive experiences while on the go tend to gravitate toward American Express cards and Membership Rewards.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Tips">Tips for Membership Rewards members</h2><p>Amex Membership Rewards points are relatively forgiving, but there are some basic rules you should know. Here&#39;s how to earn more Membership Rewards points and protect the ones you earn.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Keeping points from expiring</strong></h3><p>Amex points do not expire as long as you remain an Amex credit cardholder. But if you close an Amex credit card that earns Membership Rewards, make sure you use or transfer out your points before you terminate your account because you will lose any points when the account closes.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Best practices for points accumulation</strong></h3><p>The best ways to quickly earn Amex Membership Rewards is by signing up for new credit cards, earning the welcome bonuses on each card, and strategically spending on whichever card offers the best bonus category for the purchase you&#39;re about to make.</p><p>You can also double-dip on rewards by using a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/online-shopping-portals-maximize-rewards">shopping portal</a> when making purchases online.</p><h2 data-toc-label="FAQs">American Express Membership Rewards frequently asked questions</h2><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>How do I earn Membership Rewards points?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">You can earn Membership Rewards points with certain American Express credit cards. The rate at which you earn points varies based on the card and category of spend such as dining, travel, or groceries.</p><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>Can Membership Rewards points be transferred to airlines or hotels?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">Yes, one of the most valuable ways to use Membership Rewards points is by transferring them to Amex&#39;s large network of airline and hotel partners. You&#39;ll often get the best redemption rates by using your points for business- and first-class international flights.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>Are there any fees associated with transferring points?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">American Express sometimes charges a nominal fee for transferring points to U.S. airlines. The dollar amount will always be disclosed during the transfer process, when you need to agree to the fee and hit &#34;confirm&#34; in order to complete the transaction.&nbsp;</p><div class="read-original">Read the original article on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-ways-to-earn-use-amex-points">Business Insider</a></div>]]></content:encoded>
